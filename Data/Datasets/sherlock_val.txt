If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you.

Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret.
I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment." "But with no very good result," I remarked.

"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end." "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?" "I cannot think."

"But what, then, did the gipsies do?" "I cannot imagine." "I see many objections to any such theory." "And so do I.

I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow.

His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks.
I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields.
Ha!
He will be silent!
"If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here." "Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully.
I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play." He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.

"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather.
Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening." "We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred.
The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.

Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work." "A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising.
"Now, Mr.
And why could he not write?
I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it.

Never let yourself doubt upon that point.
I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table." I took it up and glanced at it.

"It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived." "Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive.
Rucastle is not mad.
I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion." "Upon what point?" "In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?" Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.

But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us.
"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it.
If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.
"I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them.
Let us follow it out to the bitter end.

"One other question," said he.
It is unthinkable." "And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?" "No." "And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?" "Very much so." "Was the window open?" "Yes."

She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.
I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
