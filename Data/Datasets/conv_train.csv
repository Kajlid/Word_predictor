"well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air."
not if we save every penny.
"the kids love the house, too."
another family?
have you looked in the mirror?
did you look in the desk drawer?
why doesn't it close?
what's on tv?
"that's just the altitude change, i think."
i don't think so. you'll just give me more work.
i mixed them together.
which one do you want?
i could pick only one or the other?
she's one of the prettiest girls at the school.
go do your homework.
what husband?
i think everyone will.
poodles bark a lot.
so what's the problem?
"brush, brush. spit, spit."
this is my favorite show.
i can't believe that they would lie to us.
i agree.
yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
"no, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood."
i never used to buy swiss cheese.
did you see the waiter's hands?
i gave a subscription to my parents.
do they help you run faster?
"we need cheese, bread, and ham."
"yes, the workers are very polite."
of course.
neither can i.
did it get any better?
"that's perfect. the less traffic, the better."
that's a good reason to like something.
a family with only one baby.
it has great schools.
that sounds like a dream job.
never park your car under a tree.
have you decided how you are going to vote?
so what was the score?
i think my nose was bleeding.
he moved out of our house.
it's supposed to be unlucky.
thank you very much.
are you sure?
"no, i eat the same things day after day."
but that's what pockets are for.
the speed limit is 65.
i already looked there.
oh. what good is that? i thought it gave you free money.
wow! that's terrible.
did you watch that golf tournament?
of course. did you?
why did you get a poodle?
did you double-check your nose and teeth?
maybe we should get rid of him.
yes. i remember this big tree.
i enjoy selling. i was born to sell.
a tree fell onto my dad's car.
nothing seems to work.
it's close to the beach.
oh! don't hit any more bumps!
one hundred!
a cooking show follows a sewing show.
my girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
"well, i think we are paying for it."
me too. they canceled their other news magazines.
what are you going to do?
did he die?
he will solve our problems.
no. it costs too much money.
a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too."
and we can afford it!
"that's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently?"
then maybe it's in your genes.
it's in california.
how smart are you?
i got them for forty.
"i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside."
tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
"i mean, it's just coffee."
how good is your math?
what's the weather going to be like this weekend?
how fast is he going?
have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
"one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce."
but it's real easy to slip on.
they're behind the outfield.
and eat too much.
i bought the movie. would you like to come to my house and watch it?
bears are invading our neighborhoods.
"whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face."
i knew you didn't love me.
i think we should really do something sometime.
who makes up all these jokes?
next time i'll soak it immediately.
how did you do that?
"the other team lost by three points, 101-98. "
i'm not voting for the mayor.
i'm ready for an accident.
he's a good speaker.
so why can't i have pizza for dinner?
"no, it isn't. a flat costs you time and money."
"yeah, i think i'll go."
why not?
i don't like riding the bus.
what do you put in it?
i like to watch people.
they brushed with their fingers.
"i like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."
"yes, i do."
"oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich?"
the problem is she has no problemsÂ—she's too good for me!
"sure, what did you want to do?"
yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.
yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
anything else?
oh. that's simple enough.
then you don't date her again.
but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs?
i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
me too.
that's it?
but you would buy her cd if she was pretty?
"well, would you like to go?"
they're only $5 each.
you're right. buses don't run late at night.
housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.
what time does the party start?
that's pretty old.
probably not.
"if i catch you, you'll be sorry."
what for?
thank you.
and he's really smart.
because of all the earthquakes and fires.
computers are so cool.
so what's the problem?
i'll definitely try to make it the next time.
what's so good about it?
is it easy to learn?
i haven't lately.
he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
did he crash?
for real?
of course.
"if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course."
where have you looked?
it's six years old.
life is hard.
my dad got to see the beautiful new world war ii monument.
"so, what's the problem?"
and that's not going to change anytime soon.
it was seven feet tall.
yes. that's all i ever give her.
"from now on, let's bring our own sheets."
i want sheets without stains on them.
they'll care when they see their taxes go up.
i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
so does mine.
i couldn't find any stamps.
i'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during christmas.
thank you.
it really was. you should've gone.
"yes, dad, it was."
can i pick you up friday night?
that sounds wonderful.
"yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly."
i don't know.
they had fireplaces.
yes. that's a good idea.
"what's ""variety?"
you're jammed in with people all around you.
"yes, the smart doctors are those tv news doctorsÂ—no hospitals, no patients."
but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
"oh, no. help yourself."
so?
my laptop is so slow.
it hurt her feelings.
anything else?
and grow a beard?
i'll look for you at my next party.
"like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through."
that's nice.
what's bad about it?
from now on i'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
i'm going to the movies with a friend. how about you?
you should carry them in a purse.
there are a lot of poor people in new york.
i really want it to rain today.
but you're right. there are a lot of fires.
"no, i always back up my files."
my friend stayed in a hotel on friday the thirteenth.
"well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm."
where did you go?
what height is she?
why did you do that?
i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
i live in pasadena.
you think so?
oh.
we tell our students to leave the classroom.
"well, i guess that's it."
i love my computer.
"yes, a lot of flags have stripes."
i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
i started school recently.
will you go and visit them?
he changed the game.
okay. that sounds like a fair price.
what do we need to buy?
"oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?"
what's going on?
so what did he tell you to do?
congratulations on your promotion.
something's wrong with my computer.
i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
i watered all the plants.
i can't believe how hot it is.
our team was victorious.
friends will lend you money when you're broke.
i want to go to the ball game.
about 90 of us world war ii veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m.
he might tell me to rest for a while.
bring me a better steak.
"while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food."
maybe. what is she like?
what are they paying?
you still miss him.
i honestly didn't know.
"yes, but a puppy needs shots."
being broke is no fun.
i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
with what?
uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.
that's ridiculous!
"i don't have a girlfriend, either."
i wish my eyes were blue.
that must be nice.
she's really pretty.
i have no idea how much it will cost.
the wind blows those trucks over.
i didn't love you at first.
of course you can.
how are you going to do that?
did he get rich from his poetry?
yes?
are you going to be buried next to each other?
me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains.
these are chucks.
i've been good. i'm in school right now.
i know. i really want to go to the beach.
i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
"he's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out."
why did they do that?
we need to save enough for a down payment.
"no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up."
it's close to the freeways.
but you eat fruits.
tell me how she looks.
we must be here for some reason.
"seriously, i am so excited."
my dad got to see the beautiful new world war ii monument.
our tv remote is filthy.
didn't you laugh through the whole movie? i did.
maybe four or five pounds?
did you see that puddle of water on the floor?
they're only $5 each.
because we need to buy a house.
what is your major?
"yes, we do."
i wish you luck.
why is that?
"oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean."
who would turn in a gun for $200?
my doctor said i need surgery.
the world needs more polite people like us.
oh. of course i'm ready.
the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
did you use a new blade?
"i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution."
it's so much trouble.
my friend stayed in a hotel on friday the thirteenth.
all i get is a black screen.
that's not good.
maybe the milk was bad.
see an eye doctor.
did you save any money on the sale?
i don't want to go to hell.
he's the best man for president.
i think i know who you're talking about.
your friend was unlucky.
"it may have been random, but have you?"
where's the checkbook? i'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.
a pc or a mac?
i can smell you.
"well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets."
"oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich?"
i've been great. what about you?
it went by pretty fast.
what movie are you going to see?
how many tires were cut?
i'm sleepy.
"hi, how are you. is alice there?"
the man fell asleep.
when's that?
that was a mistake.
any rain right now would be pointless.
i hope god didn't hear that.
but you can't win if you don't play.
what did you have for breakfast?
"no, because it hurts my ears."
"well, that should get you something."
let me look at our list.
i'm sorry. i'm already doing something this friday.
"wow, how exciting."
then wait till you find a tissue.
"i understand, i guess."
that's all right.
last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
"what does ""mi"" mean?"
then i have a job for you in my kitchen.
"for example, if your birth date is january 12, 1987, write 01/12/87."
have you tried nose drops?
that's a great idea.
it must be very lonely.
"yes, but i will always pet the friendly dogs."
why don't you wash it?
"okay, that won't be very crowded."
thank you very much.
i'm going to dinner with my family.
let's go to a movie.
that sounds like fun.
"her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down."
i hope that it does rain.
please don't be nosey.
everyone likes him.
i'm not sleeping on that sheet.
"no, but that was a random change of subject."
all they think about is themselves.
it comes from cows.
can't he just go online?
tell me what you've been up to.
i thought you knew.
what happened?
i'm not. i just want to know.
"oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean."
sometimes.
what are you getting for your mom?
then stop eating the bread!
the streets are clean and quiet.
the cat doesn't care about your homework.
because men like to cheat.
rich people think they're better than us.
i'm sorry for you.
yes. i bought a cadillac.
i think about twenty-five.
why?
"well, you'd better take it out front."
"i'm a man, and men don't carry purses!"
sort of like beer.
i love to go online.
i want you to clean the bathroom.
it has beautiful houses.
i'll hold you to that.
"next saturday, i'm going to have a party."
the tires on the cars.
it's always nice to finish a job.
"me, too. let's forget about germs and focus on food."
oh. but that can be a curse.
you're right. that movie is hilarious.
they had fireplaces.
a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going to be?
i did.
i think it's five miles deep.
we'll go to a french restaurant.
"of course not. if i do that, i'll lose my job."
you met a girl at the supermarket?
"okay, let's sit down."
you should bring some wipes with you.
i'll talk to you later.
i'm terrible at math.
you should have been there. it was intense.
did you feed the cat?
worried about what?
that's why we need to save money.
why not?
"that's right, it really would be."
one that won't grow up too big.
is it going to be perfect beach weather?
but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
a blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
so the cop will stop those cars?
it's probably around somewhere.
rude people are everywhere.
your orange isn't orange?
life isn't fair.
the sports guy shows us players fighting.
why not?
it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
"just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world."
not sure. is there a movie out that catches your eye?
"oh, why is that?"
then why is there mud on the carpet?
"yes, i did."
will you be able to make it?
your chances are very small.
"that's just the altitude change, i think."
don't we have about five sharpeners?
it gives you money?
you had an art class?
i hope judge judy made the seller take the phone back.
i was thinking about seeing a movie.
spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.
so what? did he dial 911?
that's exactly how i feel.
"yes, they are."
i switched from pasta to potatoes.
"she got an ""everything"" job!"
that's a switch.
no human could possibly play golf that well.
what should our flag look like?
one or two tires were cut on each car.
so is everyone else.
ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
that's a good deal.
the weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
did you find a solution?
i just wanted to let you know what happened.
i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.
the digital signal is very clear.
why me?
i'll definitely try to make it the next time.
she has pretty light brown eyes.
you're crazy.
"well, i want to see ""the pursuit of happyness."""
are you going to wash it yourself?
what do you mean?
"yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best."
this trail is hard to climb.
is that right? this is a brand new outfit.
i enjoy drawing and painting.
his life sucked. he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
bring a jacket.
i thought you heard.
i voted for obama.
see an eye doctor.
"yes, he made the home run popular."
"no, but i did put on a few pounds."
i think we are!
maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
no pets are allowed.
"well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm."
are you going to go anywhere?
of course. what are friends for?
i would like to.
that's a good question. maybe it's not old age.
it's the truth. i am really happy.
"yes, it is. but it still looks good."
"yeah, i loved that class."
then what did you do?
i didn't know you knew how to draw and paint.
a travel show follows another travel show.
"no, my sister and i will travel together."
what's so good about it?
i watered all the plants.
it's pretty big.
"the last time we went, you almost drowned."
will you lose all your files?
yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
you rolled through that stop sign back there.
"number one, it's too slow."
i was crossing the street.
i would never want to be president.
i'm pretty good. thanks for asking.
don't use water on it!
it was nothing for him.
i've called you a hundred times today.
i can't do that.
of course they talk about us.
"oh, really? that's nice."
it's not too bitter for you?
"exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. it's too hot."
what's the weather going to be like? i may want to go too.
goodbye.
"okay, she's not fat. so what's the problem with her?"
you're sitting there with your mouth open.
"yes, i like that one, too."
why is that?
you still miss him.
how much are they?
have you seen her?
me too.
it's the force that pulls everything down.
yes. that's all i ever give her.
so?
mine too.
did you put the sheets on the beds?
"i've tried everything, but nothing works."
i found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
what happened at the restaurant?
i don't like my job.
how many are there?
but i got lucky a few minutes later.
how was the weather?
i hope that i'll see you there.
"no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now."
but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
when exactly does the party start?
that's pretty simple.
i've never been to a french restaurant.
those shopping carts are dangerous.
when do you have to be at the airport?
our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.
i listen day and night.
no. i already have a pen.
"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court."
a flag should be pretty.
there are so many things you have to do right.
we get hamburgers and steak.
and then i made lunch.
"well, my english isn't perfect."
what's the matter with it?
"well, i meant to."
i agree.
i have to clean the house.
i'm not being nosey. i'm just asking.
what's wrong?
mostly talk radio.
you're right.
you must be joking.
yes. it gets a little cool at night.
she asked you about your pineapples?
bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
and there are only six units in the whole building.
what's the matter with that?
"okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat."
i couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.
i need a cheap car.
you should wet your shirt immediately.
i think i'm going to explode.
tell me about it.
how much did you buy?
it's got a big yard.
check out the silverware.
"that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not living people."
it would be nice if the weather would never change.
yes?
i sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
so i'll see you next time.
such as?
they have interesting lawsuits.
not yet. it's been a week.
you can borrow mine.
"clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet."
i'm having fun.
does god answer your prayers?
okay. i think i'll be awake by then.
"never better, thanks."
but i love pizza.
she said she didn't love me anymore.
i didn't know you had a gun.
i wasn't done talking to you.
i got divorced two years ago.
no way! i don't want to fall to my death.
"i want this trip to be perfect, i hope it stays warm."
we can be there in 20 minutes.
"no, i'm serious."
what's the weather like?
that's not a good start.
but the smell is different.
i really missed you a lot.
why haven't you answered the phone?
spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.
"for me, it's the students."
it was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
what were you doing?
he apologized to the fans.
so how do you think positive?
i go to pcc.
are you going to go and visit her and the baby?
i don't know.
what was wrong with you?
there's nothing in it.
"this friday, i'm throwing a party."
"well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces."
i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
i've been coming here for years.
do you know what you're going to do this weekend?
was there much damage?
nothing that would pass as news.
he probably won't use drugs anymore.
eat the fruit. it's good for you.
worried about what?
what about the pillowcases?
it sounds like it will be.
i don't like riding the bus.
don't you ever cheat on me.
"no, i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv."
"that's great, but you're not supposed to tell me."
why?
do you want anything to make you feel better?
i'm not sure.
i don't know. maybe i'm not rich enough.
because you don't want to smell bad.
then it will look like new
i went to school today. did you go to school?
i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.
"yes, he was on the tv news today."
"no, the banana was delicious."
it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.
at 8:00 p.m.
are you telling me that you've seen her before?
"yes, and i hope that it does."
why is that?
we haven't been in a month.
that's what i need to do.
i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
"well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with."
i'm not sure yet. is there something you want to see?
what movie are you and your friend planning on watching?
i always cry at the end.
anything else?
the cat doesn't care about your homework.
"what does she look like, though?"
they need 300 new workers.
what was the second story?
i would love to catch a movie this weekend.
were you in a crosswalk?
i'm so full i'm going to burst.
i knew you didn't love me.
do they know what the robber looks like?
but a cop might stop you.
they were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.
"okay, i'll talk to you later then."
that was nice of you.
you started eating ice cream?
"oh, really? who won?"
what do you mean?
"i don't think so. after i finish, i'll have enough money to go to college."
i'll keep my receipt and my gun.
are you sure?
"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes."
nobody has told me anything about your party.
you're trying to tell me something.
me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains.
i think some fish have blue eyes.
a blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
i'm having a party next saturday.
because you're thinking too much.
of course. i have lots of best friends.
i don't get art.
i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?
i have no idea. i've been here for 20 years.
really? why?
i went to hawaii on vacation.
"oh, no. i forgot."
"well, it's good that you're so talented."
of course you do.
i can't believe that they would lie to us.
"that would ruin things, i want to go so badly."
i'll talk to you later.
it's not comfortable.
"well, it's really none of your business."
that's a good idea.
but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
how big is los angeles?
it's the slowest hamburger in town.
it's an upstairs unit.
then i have a job for you in my kitchen.
maybe we should get rid of him.
"no, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too."
"i eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day."
everybody loves pizza.
"yes, i did."
i love to go online.
"it is delicious, especially with butter."
"that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store."
"$1,000."
i thought it was next sunday.
"we will be house rich, but cash poor."
i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
actors didn't curse back then.
of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
what did you do?
don't rub the numbers off the remote.
what do you mean?
i would like to.
that's the truth.
the book is open.
my stomach was bothering me.
you're supposed to stay home all day.
i believe so.
"yes, it's beautiful."
i believe that she will give me the invitation today.
our monthly payments will be too high.
someone has to win.
"yes, i do."
so what? they still drove off.
tell me what you've been up to.
you're wearing out your right hand. stop using it so much.
"the kids love the house, too."
yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.
is this a clean restaurant?
you're not going to be buried?
it has great weather all year long.
they want to get guns off the street.
did you save any money on the sale?
"oh, so you took an art class?"
i filled up my freezer with ice cream.
too bad i was busy. i really wanted to go.
what good does it do?
how much do we need to save?
you have no idea how happy i am for you.
they have to see it happen.
you don't like pretty women?
i'm going to dinner with my family.
we'll be at mcdonald's in just a few minutes.
that sounds like fun. let's do it.
"not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers."
so maybe we better leave at 8:15?
can we go to the baseball game?
the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
you don't have the money?
we haven't been in a while.
did he ever take art lessons?
you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
i feel so sorry for those people.
what happened?
that was an odd change of subject.
but he dives to relax.
"thanks again. you look nice today, too."
bluedog123. are you sure that's all?
did you tell her about school?
what did you do?
because he likes to scuba dive.
"okay, my seatbelt is on."
i love peanuts.

"if the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea."

and carry it into the house.
i don't like practice.
it's the automatic teller machine.
i told her that school is fun.
"yes, that will occur next month."
"no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little."
not much.
"i had a car problem, so i went online."
you're talking to her.

me neither. it's boring.
i can't afford it.
"exactly, it was my favorite class."

"i'll bet he was drinking, too."

only a dollar? don't even look for it.
a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.

okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.
why do you say that?
i'm falling asleep on the phone.
i guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
i'm in love with that girl.
is it new?
that's a lot of work.
"there are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common."
there will be another show next week.
"and ruth was a good person, too."
hmm. i have only one best friend.
"oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?"
i think he wanted to cool off.
"oh, no, you don't."
why did you do that?
do you go to college?
here he comes now.
"i know, you should really go and see her and the baby."
so what? did he dial 911?
she's really pretty.
what is it this time?
"oh. sorry. okay, i don't have four tens."
"a speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl."

"it blows trees over, too."
i first learned how to do it in high school.

"yeah, i think i'll go."
"yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you."

you're right. the buses are never on time.
sounds like a plan.
i used to cook in a restaurant!
a band-aid might not work.
the tape recorder is broken.
i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.
"yes, you have to take care of your wife."
anywhere else?
the sky is gray.

me too. i can't wait until winter.
i'll call you later.

you're right about that. keep saving your money.
he gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
"i would've come to see you sooner, but i've been busy too."

shots for what?
me neither. it's boring.
when i need something.
teaching is a great job.
why do you say that?
i don't want to see a movie by myself.
how many did he hire?
it's no problem. i was really missing you anyway.

"yes, the snow is fun."
"no, i didn't."
i think it was about 45 minutes long.
"yes, with the voter instructions."
"she asked me how she could return the favor, so i asked her out."
the book is open.
you can travel all over the world.
"okay, that won't be very crowded."
only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
my girlfriend and i sit outside starbucks.
what kind of soup was that?
what movie are you going to see?
"i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes."
that's it? that's all i have to do?
i'm stuffed.
have you heard the news?
she said that nothing is more important to me than money.
i didn't even have lunch.
that's rude.
she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
what kind of car do you have?
because i want to make a lot of money.
stop thinking about what the point is.
the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
it's to my mom.
then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
"yes, but she left him a year later."
do you want me to wake you in an hour?

you need a car with low mileage.
that one. a group of eight just sat down at it.
i don't want to date a blind woman.

i know. i think it may rain.
are you crazy?
maybe you're right.
that's exactly how i felt.
now you're thinking.
"no, thanks, maybe another time."
working.
your shoes look really nice. how much did you get them for?
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.
why not?
i'm looking. there's nothing to eat.
how did you get it?
i am dying from the heat.
i guess so.

i will have a radio in every room of my house.
the streets and sidewalks are clean.
i took something earlier.

people are funny.
what did you do?
so does every smoker.
i wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.

he's never going to make everyone happy.
do you need a pen?
really?
can we get tickets?
you know i don't like crowds.
it's too bad that i couldn't make it. who won?
"i'm sorry, but i have to go."
he hates democrats and republicans.
"it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity."
what do you mean?
oh. but that can be a curse.
that's great.
why didn't she love you anymore?
what do you mean?
so has everyone else.
what are you talking about?
neither did i.
i toss and turn all night.
"yes, but i talk to him almost every day."
i'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
how can it be fun?
"i really want to go, so i hope that she gives me my invite soon."
someone punched out someone.
i can add two and two.
good idea. it will be so much quicker.
so how do you plan to become rich?
why weren't you at school yesterday?
what did they say?
that's it?
thanks.
what happened to your plans?
i don't like that man.
"he had cigarettes, but no battery."
it shouldn't take him long to fix it.
i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.
florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.

i love baseball.
there was a bomb threat at the airport.
did they explain how it's possible?
the nation is switching to digital tv.
"my bad, i had chores to do."
i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.
i have no idea.
i'll talk to you later.
i got a promotion at work earlier this week.
and they couldn't fix your problem?
oh really? i didn't know that.
"yes. after two u.s. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway."
why would he do that?
of course it does.
i like a good story.
it's hard if you want to do it right.
the driver will just honk back at us.
are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
"if they are all outside, then what?"
"well, i need some help."
"oh, that's so delicious."
"no more free cheese for you, huh?"
"a long time ago, flying used to be okay."
i know that.
i'm going to the bank.
i love you.
look! he just hit that car.
where do you live?
maybe we should learn some good jokes.
your daddy was a good little boy.
but i am a good driver. i've never had a ticket in my life.
i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
"before you go to that interview, check yourself."
he went to las vegas. he lost it all gambling.
"so, you didn't become a doctor."
i bet you had to drag him away.
"thanks. i think you look nice today, too."
we're stuck with him for four more years.
what a great song.
and?
why me?
"well, the democratic party says it was an honest election."
i'll get her a nice card.
what do you like about it?
did you ever see anything that picasso painted?
so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
thank you. so do you.
how long was the flight?
and you get a lot of exercise every day.
why? we're already late.
i can add two and two.

i'm so full i'm going to burst.
tell me what you've been doing.
i'm not voting for the mayor.
"okay, until next time then."
thanks for letting me know.
but his latest fire killed someone.
"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly."
open the book.
i love your outfit right now.
those are nice. what are they?
yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.
i really don't think it's any of your business.
"no, i mean a salad instead of a pizza."
now he's slowing down.
i like the kinds of instruments that they use.
"no, this is the tree."
it was hot and sunny every day.
"she has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful."
they sure do.
don't mention it.
"no, i hate vegetables."
"half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing."
that's what i'm going to do.
a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
i'm on a new diet.
i did too.
they never shut up.
berries aren't in season all year round.
he stayed on the thirteenth floor.
"i couldn't go to school today, i was sick."
"don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true."
nobody has told me anything about your party.
i think there's one on the dining room table.
it seems that it may rain today.
"nothing really, you?"
i'm serious. you deserved this promotion.
i buried him with his cell phone.
and there was no violence.
and then what?
me too.
you speak two languages.
or artists.
do you like it there?
that takes some time.
i never miss the food and drink section.
"like what, for instance?"
"well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m."
neither did i.
no one would hire you to flip hamburgers.
that's dangerous.
"yes, it starts at 7 p.m."
can we call the police?
then maybe it's in your genes.
good luck!
that's terrible! when did it happen?
"no, because i'm eating food that i like."
what time?
that's terrible. i would never go to your restaurant.
"well, you can't blame a man for asking."
the internet is amazing.
i'm watching you.
you'd better take an umbrella.
"hi, how are you doing?"
that sounds a lot easier than sewing.
what happened to the other student?
sounds good. what did you have in mind?
why do we need to save money?
it's common sense.
what's that?
really? why is it?
"well, listen to me. you need to buy a ticket now."
i always do. did you go to school today?
i'll get him one of those little dogs.
just hold on.
cigarette lighters. i'll make a fortune.
"no, i didn't go, i've been sick."
think about something else. think about a hamburger.
yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
was he smoking?
"they don't work, either."
cats have beautiful eyes.
what did you do?
"because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying."
every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
what are they?
but i do all my writing with my right hand.
"they always tell us ""what's next."""
i'm still feeling under the weather.
i'm so happy for you.
did you hear about the pilot?
"yes, i know. some people are rude."
that's what i need to do.
i didn't love you at first.
everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
speaking. what's up?
why do you hate to go outside?
i haven't looked anywhere yet.
they work great.
"not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers."
"considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird."
don't we have about five sharpeners?
are you sure?
i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.
i go to pasadena city college.
so i should stop thinking?
"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers."
two guys got into an argument.
are you sure?
those are great. how much were they?
i don't know.
is it his money?
your daddy was a good little boy.
you're sitting there with your mouth open.
that's what i thought.
why do they want tax cuts?
"well, i guess that's why he did it."
we went to a nice restaurant.
what's the weather like?
i don't understand some things.
i was sick.
i cut my finger.
what's the matter?
i'll say.
why not?
i hope you feel better.
and watch your dvd.
and he's really smart.
only if my candidate wins.
i can't do that.
why would i do that?
i have a honda.
"no, i figure i'll finish it all by next week."
"boy, that is a good nose."
"no, he won't. some cars are doing 85."
nothing.
smokers think they are so cool.
"no, i didn't go, i've been sick."
my family and i are going to dinner.
"i haven't told you what happened yet, have i?"
so why are you arguing with me? don't lie in the sun too long!
why is that?
that will make him so happy.
the cops finally found the husband.
what happened to your car?
a ham sandwich.
"oh, my goodness. no one is safe on the streets."
"without gravity, you would go up."
it got rained out.
i shook it. there is no more ink.
really? why is it?
"well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?"
"well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today."
"thank you very much, that's kind of you."
i wish i was free that night. i'm kind of mad that i didn't go.
what's on tv?
me too. there are no guarantees.
"i'm very hungry. i'll order for you, and then i'll eat yours."
one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
we should really hang out again.
i had to. i was missing you a lot.
i have a stomachache.
his nails were black!
i need to type to make money.
i need some pants.
that's a good idea.
i'll get him one of those little dogs.
i injured my back one time just by sneezing.
bluedog123. are you sure that's all?
"yes, i did. i saved about $50."
i haven't heard anything about it.
would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?
no one at work likes him.
"oh, no. we can walk right in."
"oh great, we could both work at burger king."
the son gave a nice speech about his father.
what did the doctor say?
it's sunday.
how can i prove it?
get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
there's something wrong with my orange.
my family and i are going to dinner.
our school did. they played really well.
"well, why don't you?"
you think i should quit playing.
we're funny-looking because we wear clothes.
good! i just thought i'd let you know.
did you go to the basketball game on friday?
"no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school."
how's it going?
okay. i'll feed him right now.
they sure are.
i went to the beach every day.
did you read this article?
especially on a hot day like this.
i'm not in the mood.
"no, i haven't."
i don't even know why we need to fix it.
why?
i teach high school english.
is it your birthday or anniversary?
"you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?"
let's stop for a while. i need a break and some water.
i have no insurance.
it's not too big.
that's not the attitude of a good driver.
we watch people walk by with their dogs.
there's nothing in it.
"if you get sick, i'll return the favor."
so?
look at this sheet.
i will play the radio as loud as i want.
high school.
don't pick your nose.
maybe he ran out of gas.
they might think i'm stupid.
what kind of dog do you have?
"you'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it."
i type too much.
i don't think so.
yes. i've never been there.
it's the best job i've ever had.
are you right-handed?
really? how many do you have?
it would be nice if the weather would never change.
you'd better try them on first.
you're smart.
that's nice.
some people do it just to do it.
that's a bad day.
i would say she's only five feet.
but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
and be happy together.
i want to show you my new car.
i had a long day.
"i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?"
of course you are. you ate everything on the table.
i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
i want to go on a cruise ship.
do you feel better now?
here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.
"no, thanks. i already took some medicine."
"yes, that's right. it does get boring."
were you speeding?
prove it.
"no, i'm not. it's march. time is running out. seats are selling out right now."
that is true. i hope it doesn't rain.

i've just been working a lot.
who cares?
"well, it gives me money, but it's my own money."

"no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left."
i eat the same thing every day.
i wish i could afford first class seats.

"no, but i did put on a few pounds."
i don't know. look in the fridge.
i'm really happy that you came to visit me.
i want to get a puppy for my son.
"i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside."
he thinks i have too much stress.

that will cost him some money.
i'm actually in school right now.
because you can see the stars perfectly.
even if it's only for a short while.
the bread is in the cabinet.
"really, where did you get it?"

but they can just knock on the door.
of course. but i don't have cable.
no problem.

it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.
i don't like it.
yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.
that's the reason it was such a great game.
"no, he didn't have time to do that."

"what's ""variety?"
"yes, it was love at first sight."
the only thing in my backpack is used books.
are you enjoying it there?
you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.
of course.
rude people are everywhere.
"yeah, let's do that."
why are they doing this?
"no, i want to go to the movies instead."
that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
"i couldn't help laughing, either. "
what's the matter with green eyes?
you can wear this one around the house.
i didn't hear anything about it.
of course. it's not a hard job.
that sounds like fun.
i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.
"i'll vote for him next time, too."
my father found a new girlfriend.
"when you miss a day of school, i'll be happy to give you the english assignments."

to the state or the city?
neither can i.
i didn't know you had a gun.
i thought school was hard.
is that right?
"first of all, he was half an hour late."
who invited them?
"well, most corporations do think only about money."
stop thinking about what the point is.
"well, did you want to go see a movie with me?"
"no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up."
what kind of car do you have?
it was on sale.
why is that?
"no, it's dark pink!"
i thought you had an elephant in your house.
i don't know. it's not my mud.
i'm not sure.
who?
where does cheese come from?
"yeah, but i'm still waiting for my invitation."
but it's real easy to slip on.
of course! he's world famous.
your wallet is empty?
what did you say to her?
"well, i think we are paying for it."
have you taken anything for your cold?
"then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale."
but the show will be over.
but the house is so nice.
she had good reason. what did she do?
thanks.
"hmm, that's not bad."
you mean he could drown.
"you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold."
any rain right now would be pointless.
of course they say thatÂ—their man won!
"brush, brush. spit, spit."
"yes, just like fruit that is too ripe."
"yes, i did."
that means it will get hotter.
thank you. that's polite of you to ask.
"man, that was a really close game."
yes. i have to breathe through my mouth.
i already looked there.
did you have to blow right next to the phone?
"when i have time, i sometimes draw and paint."
why don't you go to bed?
he might tell me to rest for a while.
"considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird."
"yes, i like that one, too."
i'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.

but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
then you can wipe your seat and window.
i like to slide into the bases.
we must be here for some reason.
in case we have visitors.
maybe we can go see a movie or something.
i just insert my debit card into the machine.
"yes, rained out."
"yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers."
"always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely."

there's no food in the woods.

of living.

it starts at 8 o'clock.
"every time we eat out, it's an adventure."
what do they say?
"okay, i'll talk to you later then."
stress causes your stomachaches?
what are you talking about?
tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.
of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet.
i'll be there.
i'm watching you.
"yes, it's beautiful."
it was before i was born.
parking at school is impossible.
what's that?
it's such a chore.
what happened before?
do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house.
maybe. i'm not sure.
i don't know anyone who likes it.
"i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you."
then what?
"it blows trees over, too."
it has wonderful restaurants.
yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
all you will get is sore knuckles.
eleven cars.
it gives you all the news.
"next time you go to the market, let me go with you."
i've been thinking about learning spanish.
you should see a doctor.
i'll bet the car continued on its way.
thank you.
so has everyone else.
"no, he didn't have time to do that."
"yes, and i put the pillowcases on the pillows."
"it usually gets here at noon on tuesday, which is tomorrow."
a blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
"well, i guess that's it."
why is that?
i gave a subscription to my parents.
"oh, why is that?"
i love your outfit right now.
i'll be glad when winter comes.
you have to be lucky to find a parking space.
so it's not worth much?
that was very nice of you.
they want tax cuts.
i can't wait till all my teeth fall out.
the police need to shoot all the bears.
"this year he gave away $15,000."
the husband said he tried to help the boy.
but maybe prices will be cheaper in october.
we'd better get ready to go.
what was the lead story on the news?
that was mean to say.
my stomach was upset.
that's not nice.
i enjoyed talking to you too.
"yes. it isn't there, either."
i want to go to see a movie this weekend.
"nothing really, you?"
have you told her?
what's the point?
i bet it says he was born on mars.
because i was watching you.
yes. i would buy all of her cds.
i think they're in the medicine cabinet.
"my bad, i had chores to do."
"yes, of course i wiped my feet."
so why are we selling our house?
i meet too many jerks.
we're stuck with him for four more years.
what happened?
that's for sure.
is it in northern california?
the officer said the red hand was blinking.
they're best when they're hot.
of course you can.
why not?
"no, today people like lots of action."
where did you lose it?
and we can afford it!
a girl i met at the market.
do you have any other skills?
yes. it's on every afternoon.
i was scratching my nose.
but what if i'm a fish in my next life?
what's the point?
what time does your plane leave?
what kind of music do you enjoy listening to?
what are you doing this weekend?
i'm not sleeping on that sheet.
then you flew back home that evening?
why is that?
what do they say?
what does she do?
"yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers."
the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
that's a good deal.
look how many cars are waiting in line.
check your tires or you'll get a flat.
the price of stamps goes up and up.
have you met the new girl?
let me get the keys.
of course they are. they're starving to death.
"no, it doesn't. puppies are free."
this wind is dangerous for drivers.
"yes, of course i wiped my feet."
"i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too."
when did you lose it?
i know. i had to chase you for a while.
a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
and i want to get a big cabin with a view.
i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
"the island is so green, and the water is so blue."
but i'm listening to it.
do you know why i pulled you over?
have you seen a doctor?
i hate medication. it makes me feel different.
of course i will.
do they know what the robber looks like?
i'm going to have to say that superbad is the best movie ever.
not yet. i won't need to do that until i graduate from high school.
but the same thing day after day gets old.
we each get five cards.
i wish i had a talent like that.
i really wish the weather would just stay the same.
a good story is more important than color.
i agree. pasadena is a nice city.
"yes, i did. i saved about $50."
how can it be fun?
"yes, i've passed all my tests."
here he comes now.
of course. what else?
what did you buy?
i feel so sorry for those people.
i've actually been pretty good. you?
what are you talking about?
"well, it's one of them."
"when i started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking."
remind me to never visit you.
how many best friends do you have?
are you feeling any better?
i love to eat the hot dogs.
i think i'll buy both of them.
it was the best game ever.
"it doesn't matter. old blades cut, new blades cut."
do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
me too.
she said she didn't love me anymore.
that's no good.
"well, listen to me. you need to buy a ticket now."
three different people will give you three different stories.
he's rude and he yells a lot.
she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
"oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us."
high school or middle school?
he never wins your money?
i'm going to pcc.
i will.
it wasn't that loud.
"no, i haven't."
"yeah, maybe next time."
so? that's a ticket?
they're very comfortable.
that's harsh.
i sure do.
"yes, i do."
our school did. they played really well.
"yes, i did."
what do you like about it?
what's wrong with them so soon?
did he sign it?
i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.
i want to cruise to hawaii.
they need a left-turn arrow.
can't they eat grass?
"if the company goes out of business, i'll have nothing."
"well, that's cool."
then neither do women singers.
"no, but that was a random change of subject."
i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
they're not going to think that! they'll be glad to help you.
paper can be dangerous.
how many did he hire?
i especially love the night air when it rains.
all the radios will be on extra loud.
i stood on the great wall and looked all around.
read the phone number to me.
she had good reason. what did she do?
it was nice talking to you.
"that's not what i meant by ""do something."""
the worst in the whole world.
"oh, yes. we all took lots of pictures."
of course i'm sure.
maybe it's the wrong tree.
especially the metal ones.
"well, i would never buy her cd."
is that it?
why not?
"yeah, me too."
i had a busy morning.
you eat too much chocolate.
"yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space."
"i have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey."
do you pray to god?
what's wrong with them so soon?
of course not.
so how have you been lately?
i don't really feel too well yet.
i have to go shopping today.
one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
did you hear the news?
oh! don't hit any more bumps!
he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.
yuck! no water for me.
some private organization.
"thanks again. you look nice today, too."
different thingsÂ—not the same thing all the time.
neither have i.
thank goodness! i don't want to see any wild animals.
"well, hold on a little longer."
don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
why not?
because it will protect you in case of an accident.
i'm sorry for you.
like fruit that is too ripe?
that's a lot of work.
he's been in jail three times already.
what's wrong with that?
"it doesn't matter. old blades cut, new blades cut."
who were you writing to?
"they make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave."
"it's not too much, only about $85."
it's called poker.
then why are you watching tv?
did you want to go?
"okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat."
i'm not sure.
"no, please tell me."
"maybe we'd get laid off there, too."
you can help me.
"he might relax, but it makes me nervous."
what makes him so bad?
where do you get that?
"so, it's pretty old now."
me too. that movie brought tears to my eyes.
there sure areÂ—at least a million.
ask the clerk.
"without gravity, you would go up."
that's because they cook it while you wait.
did you go swimming?
i go to pcc.
"if you lose your job, you can move in with me."
talk to you then.
i've actually been busy lately.
"if not, your nose will wake you up."
call me tomorrow then.
where do you want to go?
just be patient. fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
of course i do. but not on our flag!
i had fun talking to you.
"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave."
what's the matter? this is a nice room.
paper can be dangerous.
i think it will only take you a year or two.
"yes, they do."
is it something you ate?
what do you mean?
another family?
i'd like that.
it's not even noon yet.
i have to go back upstairs.
what a great song.
i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
to show respect to god and others.
i was going to be a doctor.
"me, too. i couldn't wait to graduate."
how many invitations has she given out?
what do you need to do?
why not?
were you jaywalking?
"thank you for inviting me, but i think i'll pass."
"you're not lying, i found that movie absolutely hilarious."
it's hard if you want to do it right.
i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
it's pretty big.
i haven't decided yet.
what will you do when the battery dies?
it must be very lonely.
"if more people donate money, pbs could offer new shows."
heard what?
maybe a pound or two.
but think about all the power you'd have.
do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
the next four years will be good years.
that's a good deal.
how much was that?
"if i smelled bad, i could smell me."
they're in the kitchen drawer.
i'll call you so we can set that up.
they should find a nice hobby.
that sounds wonderful.
"well, she's quite short."
it's close to the mountains.
doesn't everybody?
why feel sorry for rich people?
all you've lost is some sweat.
of course it did. why stop after you've run over two people?
"i love to watch ""judge judy."""
i feel the same way. it smells so good after it rains.
they talk about food and the weather.
we can go to the river.
there is no crime here.
did you look in your desk?
too bad i was busy. i really wanted to go.
because tax cuts will save them money.
that's okay with me.
"if you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day."
even though they're in black and white.
i didn't know that you saw superbad before.
that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
so she likes poodles.
they should find a nice hobby.
is that right? i already got my invitation from her earlier.
all the news in only 50 pages.
"well, you'd better take it out front."
that's a bad day.
are your nails clean?
i'm a babysitter.
what kind?
a movie sounds good.
i was hoping you would come.
i have no idea.
but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.
i don't know why i bother to vote.
they go out to the north parking lot.
maybe you should stop shaving.
"well, hold on a little longer."
is there anything you would like to do next time?
why do you say that?
"it's a little chilly, right?"
i put lemon and butter in it.
a band-aid might not work.
"well, it won't last forever."
have you heard my good news?
"yes, but i will always pet the friendly dogs."
i wish it would cool off one day.
don't drink milk out of the carton. use a glass!
"first, i have to find the button."
i'm doing well. how about you?
"i found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me."
they probably will.
so are we going to buy it?
thank goodness! i don't want to see any wild animals.
why?
they probably wouldn't like that.
you should loosen your belt.
"yes, it's april 22."
the street isn't wet.
"they make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave."
i went to school today. did you go to school?
where's the mustard?
i did.
i don't want fruit. i want something tasty.
"yes. and a pickle, if we have any."
you drink too much coffee.
did you call the repairman?
i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
"how big is ""pretty big""?"
do you think i'm getting fat?
"don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true."
but practice makes perfect.
"it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity."
why do you say that?
the point of what?
"lately, i've been quite busy."
"yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers."
there will never be another babe.
can't we hire more police?
"oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?"
it will cost you only $20 plus parts.
what do you need five of them for?
i buy it at the dollar store.
i'm going to take five wipes.
"oh, really?"
"yes, it was love at first sight."
and they were expensive houses.
"yes, it is."
"then i add butter, salt, and pepper."
now they're adding old tv shows to the old movies.
they want 20 percent down.
those books will slip and you'll fall.
it was tomato soup.
let me get the keys.
when did you get divorced?
you might want to buy a pair.
her mom is a great cook.
i listen to various types of music.
thank you. i just got this outfit the other day.
those shopping carts are dangerous.
would you like to go on a blind date?
"i found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me."
"it's a little bitter, but it's okay."
what was it like?
"yes, if they do it quickly."
what are you going to do with them?
i think about twenty-five.
"they always make ""what's next"" sound exciting, but it never is."
somebody should check his birth record.
but most of those hurricanes are harmless.
"if we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell."
i like my food hot and fresh.
"same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp."
what do you want to do next time?
they sure do.
thank you.
of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
everyone in america should have a gun.
who cares? everyone is strange.
can't you take medicine or something for it?
the battery was dead.
i think we'll be there in half an hour.
i like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.
what do you need for school?
kids are crying or climbing over you.
what for?
you had pizza for lunch.
"no, it's too close to the salad bar."
would you like anything for your stomach?
a good gun costs $400 or more.
"""Â…there will be an answer, let it be!"""
"it may have been random, but have you?"
did they catch him?
i parked it right here.
sometimes.
"well whatever, i'm glad you came."
i don't even know why we need to fix it.
where are we going?
we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
nothing that's interesting.
"thanks. i think you look nice today, too."
i hope that it does rain.
i was taught in high school how to draw and paint.
at night i went out to eat. the food was delicious.
that's too bad.
check out the silverware.
that will cost him some money.
it was before i was born.
i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
you should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.
artists see things differently.
shake it a couple of times.
who did you vote for?
did you check all your pockets?
that election for u.s. senator stunk.
maybe i'll teach middle school.
don't you want me to clean up the mud?
it's really nice.
is that a lot of work?
"yeah, i went. did you go?"
who?
that's a good idea.
"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection."
how about you see a movie with me and my friend?
when are we going to stop?
"i wanted to go, but i couldn't."
my husband died.
are you right-handed?
"yes, but i love the night air after it rains."
"a dentist, i'm sure."
let's go now. i'm hungry!
then you should watch the rerun.
i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
"her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down."
what does that have to do with it?
okay. what will you teach me?
yikes. i think i'll keep my long distance service.
room service brought us a cold dinner.
why?
why not?
you're kidding.
maybe i will be the first!
they are so weak.
what was your last job?
this is she. how's it going?
ready for the big switch.
are you ready?
do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
"well, how tall is she?"
i'll get the bait.
that must have made you feel really special.
"i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?"
the election is next week.
what's the matter?
good! i just thought i'd let you know.
and there are only six units in the whole building.
"no, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president."
why do you want to move there?
people today don't like that.
no. they said there are some things you can't explain.
"well, i can always pull over."
doing what?
thank you very much.
i'm not sure.
they're all so cute.
i had a stomachache.
"who knows? you live, and then you die."
i don't want to go alone.
you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
no. it costs too much money.
it was like being there?
are you looking for another job?
i'm not. i just want to know.
i'm sorry to hear that. would you like the assignments from english class?
maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean.
especially on these slick floors.
then stop eating the bread!
so do i.
your day was just like mine.
it's supposed to start at about eight.
it seems fine to me.
that's what i do.
i hope god didn't hear that.
what did you wash?
where are all these people going?
turn on the air conditioner.
i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
because you get to meet a lot of people.
not much.
he spoke to them and made them feel better.
open the book.
luxury plus speed.
"then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist."
i think it's an old people's smell.
not yet.
me too.
i thought i would wait until october.
"no, you didn't. let's go! the only thing running is the clock!"
"when i started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking."
lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
"no, it's too close to the salad bar."
"yes, but i talk to him almost every day."
i'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
yes. all my life.
i checked all my pockets.
it starts at 8 o'clock.
last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
"i'm sure i'll like it, too."
then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
i enjoy rock and r&b.
"no, thanks. maybe another time."
i took something earlier.
"some men do, but not me."
"yes, they are."
and he yelled back at me.
how much money does he give away?
there were more votes than voters!
you know what that means.
three packs of what?
thanks a lot.
i don't think he even got paid for it.
"i understand, i guess."
all day long we heard tvs or telephones.
that's great. congratulations.
but you can't win if you don't play.
occasionally.
maybe you should stop shaving.
female singers are supposed to be pretty.
no one speaks perfect english.
that sucks. did you want the assignments from english class?
this city is full of jerks.
"yes, i saw it on the tv news."
maybe the mayor is just talking about his own neighborhood.
"yes, it's april 22."
then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
people who live in california are crazy.
"so, forget it."
i've been good. i'm in school right now.
he's a chain smoker.
i really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 
why did they invite him?
the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
they say he has started fifteen big fires.
"oh, that's terrible. what does she look like now?"
i think some fish have blue eyes.
to show respect to god and others.
see you later.
i didn't know that.
he might want to cut you open.
she's cute.
"you should be happy, not worried."
the point of what?
that will teach him a good lesson.
but people still write poems.
do pimples run in your family?
"boy, that is a good nose."
nonfat.
what kind?
i saw it eight times.
me neither.
"well, mostly i'll try to avoid it."
what do you mean?
because a puppy costs money.
what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
i will knock on the doors of all the corporations.
why would i do that?
"well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents."
does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
what's your mailing address?
it has the rose parade.
did you really?
it's an ugly day today.
my car is dirty.
what's the matter?
the officer said the red hand was blinking.
that's okay.
that means month/day/year. use numbers.
they forget where they came from.
the sky looks so clean after it rains. i love it.
"but, mom, i'm not dirty."
did she get a nice job?
you know how to draw and paint?
you can borrow mine.
"would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?"
what's your favorite thing to do?
or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
what do you mean?
we can go to the river.
i'll go.
use a tissue next time.
we'll get warmer as we walk.
i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.
don't you want me to clean up the mud?
"oh, no. we can walk right in."
it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
"i'll vote for him next time, too."
i'm getting married.
who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
"when you finish, all you do is start another job!"
you'd think a library would be safe from thieves.
you're right. i think it's going to rain later.
did you give him a nose?
okay. i'll tell you how the show ends.
i've actually been busy lately.
what are you reading?
"oh no, another pimple on my face."
people are always getting up to use the bathroom.
so?
what if i don't like her?
what was the reason for your call?
"what does she look like, though?"
no. it's in southern california.
tell me about this patch.
it's one dollar for 100 minutes.
i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
"no, you didn't. you slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop."
of course i will.
i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.
"no, you didn't. you slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop."
doctors are too expensive.
i don't know.
i think i might've bumped into her before.
i'm still feeling a little sick.
it's getting later every minute.
i usually eat a simple salad.
or you can stay off planes.
i guess they haven't read this article.
he sounds like a real jerk.
what are you going to do with them?
that's unbelievable. can he still breathe?
yes. it is a great movie.
"that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water."
i did.
yes. i bought a cadillac.
do you think a bear is a cow?
they also ate with their fingers!
i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.
i think my nose was bleeding.
i'm going to call you soon. 
yes. you really deserved this.
how much is it?
that's hard to take.
"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet."
i agree 100 percent.
it's the funniest movie that i've ever seen.
i washed the sheets and towels.
me too. i want to play for the yankees.
i'm a handyman.
"yes, a thrift shop has that same smell."
"seriously, it looks really nice on you. where did you buy it from?"
"yes, i did."
i washed the sheets and towels.
"i enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes."
perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.
of course not. that would be racist.
they should stay in the woods where they belong.
"oh, look. here's another shirt just like it."
i really don't want to go by myself.
"well, a d is better than an f."
is that what you really think?
now you're mine forever.
that's a great idea.
i got a dent in the parking lot.
did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
i really don't think it's any of your business.
my mother was hurt and angry.
"especially if it's the same work, over and over."
"well, i've seen them eating berries."
"i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges."
that sounds like a good spot.
they bark at everything.
so are cigarettes.
don't be ridiculous.
we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.
that wouldn't seem right.
these are called all star chuck taylors.
i like the ones i can sing along with.
there are other things i need to take care of.
"that's how i feel, i want winter to come soon."
that was an odd change of subject.
i will talk to your father about that.
me too.
but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
that's it?
they said i need a new hard drive.
it didn't smell bad.
i'm so happy for you.
a cooking show follows a sewing show.
how did he do it?
they said they need more money.
of course. did you?
you might hit someone in the head.
what kind?
let's go to your home.
i got a ticket downtown for $140.
sure. why not?
"no, he said he gently placed the boy on the street."
what did you do?
where is pasadena?
that's terrible! when did it happen?
thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever.
i think that you look very cute today.
i want to buy lunch.
are you going to travel alone?
i have to check the stove.
"well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain."
like what?
did he die?
here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.
of course it does.
i have no insurance.
she told him to drop his girlfriend.
i'm having a party this friday.
did he say what time?
you should stop drinking coffee.
i like the ones i can sing along with.
i'll go up front and talk to the manager.
i'm joining the army.
i thought you just bought a pair.
"well, there is one good table."
i read a lot.
"yes, and i hope that it does."
what genres?
she weighs 98 pounds.
but girls like guys who are funny.
"no, thank you. all you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars."
"and when elected, they go their own way."
my shoes are shined.
so what? they still drove off.
but thieves don't know that.
i always try to be polite.
that's a lot of money.
can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?
"also, there aren't enough police."
buy a new one.
i don't know. i think i'm average.
it's a lot better than paying someone $60.
he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
you have no idea how happy i am for you.
describe her to me.
what happened?
please?
it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
thanks. i found these new shoes earlier at the store.
i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
why is that?
that was my favorite class.
of course. it's all over the news.
of course i do. but not on our flag!
you must be joking.
i enjoyed talking to you.
"whatever it is, it hurts."
same here.
i missed the tv news last night. what was on?
"well, if i have a big test at school."
you don't need a good nose for thatÂ—cigarettes stink.
i was on a plane.
"so, i'll just buy another one."
i lost my new pen.
how about a movie?
the street isn't wet.
but people still write poems.
"i know, you're absolutely right."
i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
was something wrong with the phone?
i really wish the weather would just stay the same.
he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
i sure hope so.
he will be a great president.
i always try to be polite.
will you go and visit them?
because it has great teachers.
you can't see the end of it.
yes?
doesn't that get old?
thank you. i'll buy a new one tomorrow.
i think that she is very pretty.
"well, congratulations."
we can leave if we put an orange cone here.
i'd rather not.
what do you mean?
it's the force that pulls everything down.
"well, he's made a few changes."
what was it like?
i bought some new shoes.
i guess you see lots of different dogs.
why is it so slow?
the seats and windows are dirty.
what's wrong with looking pale?
once in a while is once too many.
i need a notebook.
i see that former president bush is at a conference.
the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
i had to take my friend to the airport.
what was your last job?
exactly what?
how much were they?
but that's what most people do.
i'm glad sunday is only once a week.
"yeah, so are you planning on going?"
another good deal.
but no one knows for sure.
i like listening to different kinds of music.
it looks like blood.
look in the fridge.
they hope they will go to heaven.
i'm throwing a party on friday.
"i couldn't go to school today, i was sick."
i don't know. i just woke up.
i had to blow my nose.
i guess you can't go back to that restaurant.
my sister had a cold. she gave it to me.
it can be dangerous.
that's a good idea.
"so then, why don't you just go?"
it hurt her feelings.
"so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything."
i got laid off.
i can't believe he hasn't crashed.
"yes, it is."
what's wrong with that?
because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
i don't know. maybe i'm not rich enough.
no way! i don't want to fall to my death.
then why does everyone lock their doors?
did you find a spot?
me too.
i don't feel like going.
i really don't want to go by myself.
because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.
"yeah, are you going to come?"
i've never heard him say please or thank you.
i think you'll love the food.
oh. that's not good.
"nothing, how about you?"
what did they say?
"yes, you have to take care of your wife."
"it's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today."
just wait until you're 50 years old.
that's a lot of money.
"tell me, what do you enjoy doing in your spare time?"
is that right?
of course. she's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.
what time does the party start?
i was busy doing something. i apologize.
"i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset."
"in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too."
you think they won't fit?
how much is it?
did he understand what the problem is?
of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house.
what are you standing on?
a bull chased a man in a supermarket.
do you know which one he would like?
maybe we should get going.
i didn't think you saw that movie.
"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet."
get better.
"no, i couldn't make it."
you are so smart!
"if they don't like it, they can move."
i wish i had a talent like that.
"no, i just blow my nose a lot."
"well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today."
that's very nice.
the husband of the driver who ran over two college students at 3 a.m.
someone punched out someone.
or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
why's that?
"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard."
it only took about two hours.
i know. i think it may rain.
"yes, it would be. "
"oh yes, you did."
i think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
no. movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
did you tell her about school?
he's a famous artist.
"well, i can always pull over."
didn't you laugh through the whole movie? i did.
i'll bet you were hungry!
"and it's deep, too."
do you believe the tv ads?
it's too bad that i couldn't make it. who won?
you should go to bed.
"man, that was a really close game."
i will as soon as i finish this article.
you're right. you have to stand in the aisle.
the cat is meowing. he's hungry.
"well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different."
you should loosen your belt.
they are having a good time with our money.
"well, i know how to flip hamburgers."
he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
do you need a calculator?
did you ever see anything that picasso painted?
he has a very strict diet.
i didn't hear anything about it.
and they couldn't fix your problem?
"well, hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today."
look at the bottom of my shoesÂ—they're clean.
i am dying from the heat.
it was seven feet tall.
i know. i had to chase you for a while.
i thought you had a job.
what was the score at the end of the game?
that's too bad. how much is a new one?
i don't know.
i would love for it to rain today.
they work great.
what are you going to be doing?
"yes, it's a $140 ticket."
"yes, i dried everything in the dryer."
you don't have the money?
oh really? she gave me mine earlier today.
"oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us."
our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.
i can't afford it.
but the smell is different.
i'm pretty good. thanks for asking.
maybe we should honk the horn next time.
i can't wait.
i had to bring work home with me.
like what?
a bull chased a man in a supermarket.
and grow a beard?
of course.
i'm busy this friday. i'm sorry.
but think about all the power you'd have.
"but someone's going to break it, so what good is it?"
"no, this is the tree."
look how many cars are waiting in line.
i would say she's only five feet.
do you want anything to make you feel better?
the people are friendly.
did he set a new record?
"oh, all over the world."
we'll be at mcdonald's in just a few minutes.
more and more people are using macs.
i don't have even one dollar in it.
that's true. where did that money go?
sure. why do you need it?
i've really been working a lot lately.
many shirts come with an extra button.
they're all the same.
i will talk to your father about that.
that's what you think.
and then what?
i need to withdraw some money.
and it's a corner unit.
what about the baseball game?
or we can go to the ocean.
would you like to go to dinner or something?
that's my perfume.
of course they talk to each other.
maybe. i'm not sure.
what's the rush?
"oh, really? who won?"
how much did you buy?
what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
"no, it's earth day."
i need a job.
"with toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice."
that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?
i'll rinse the car first.
you didn't read about the company first?
yes. good for you.
i got a d in college chemistry.
"the government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay."
"yes, it is."
why do they call it the good old days?
good luck with school.
and he poured water into our glasses.
do you think i'll forget to do it?
"i know he has a good hand, so i don't bet."
i've tried to quit so many times.
"no, the police don't care."
how do you like it?
i can't quit smoking.
it sounds like it will be.
"that was a great trip to washington, d.c."
i don't see anything.
it's probably around somewhere.
it's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
have you done your homework?
nothing really. how about you?
"number two, it's usually late."
my back is killing me.
i started shopping at the dollar store.
the man fell asleep.
me too.
why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour.
they pay money to play this silly game!
and lots of books.
why was that?
which one?
our monthly payments will be too high.
what's the matter?
fine. what's going on with you?
so why can't i have pizza for dinner?
how did you like it?
he hates corporations.
"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him."
did you want to go?
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery.
maybe he had a good reason.
of course. we gave him a big carrot for a nose.
i was a painter.
what time does it start?
you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.
i think so. it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.
i think about nice things.
did you shine your shoes?
i was missing you too.
i hate shots.
it's a flying zoo!
i'm looking. there's nothing to eat.
are you going to be there?
everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
how do you prepare the potatoes?
so am i.
how do you prepare the potatoes?
why feel sorry for rich people?
"i know, it does sound pretty awesome."
our team played hard and won.
someone had to chop the wood.
i want to cruise to hawaii.
i'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
which one do you want?
maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
how fast is he going?
that's a good idea.
i enjoy rock and r&b.
you can travel all over the world.
"bluedog123 is just the street. you have to give me the city, state, and zip code."
"thank you for inviting me, but i think i'll pass."
what's that?
i'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
eight o'clock.
i think there are more fish.
because a puppy costs money.
most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
you have a talent. you just don't know what it is yet.
i'll make an appointment tomorrow.
are you serious?
we'd better get ready to go.
"he said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it."
let's turn on the heat.
i hope that i'll see you there.
that's a good deal.
"your driver's license and registration, please."
"everybody loved him, all over the nation."
i've got to go.
"number two, it's usually late."
"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection."
what's wrong with that?
i need a job.
i have only a few friends.
"anyway, i have to fix the hole."
"oh, that's easy."
have you seen our waiter?
the walls were so thin.
that's harsh.
"you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?"
it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.
"it's too far from your job, isn't it?"
of course.
they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
you don't need a good nose for thatÂ—cigarettes stink.
that's six times a year!
"okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner."
how much were they?
i guess people just don't care.
i hope the police catch him.
"nothing, except my favorite color is blue."
have you tried earplugs?
"i don't have a girlfriend, either."
turn on the light.
i hope your mom broke up with him.
they trust in god.
"no, the white walk sign was blinking."
that must have made you feel really special.
you should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.
"when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another."
i don't think i'm going to dream about anything. i'm really tired.
what's wrong with looking pale?
you should have been there. it was intense.
you have a lot of plants.
that sounds like a good spot.
it's not my fault. you didn't wake me up.
"boy, i'm glad that job is finished."
"i'm not sure, but i don't think she's given out that many."
think about something else. think about a hamburger.
what's wrong?
bye.
"a lot, like the party i'm having on friday."
what was the second story?
of course.
i don't like practice.
i loved you the first day i saw you.
no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.
would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?
nobody told me.
it's the slowest hamburger in town.
i just wanted to give you the good news.
i love all their songs.
"you were, too."
rained out?
but we just got here.
that's a good idea.
what kind of dressing do you use?
the home run hitter on drugs?
are you going to wash it yourself?
what are those wipes for?
i have to get off the phone now.
"""deal or no deal"""
"if they are all outside, then what?"
okay. i did something.
mostly talk radio.
where did you park it?
when did you lose it?
"yes, it's very dirty."
that's not good.
just put them in the fridge.
i know. every day the weather seems different.
what did she say?
"you're not lying, i found that movie absolutely hilarious."
they didn't say.
your shoes look really nice. how much did you get them for?
because you're thinking too much.
i want to get a puppy for my son.
don't let water get into any of the cracks.
the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
did you hear that?
"well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night."
i don't understand.
you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
you're a lucky man to have a job you love.
hopefully it will.
i mean i have wonderful students.
"me, too. i love them roasted and salted."
i was on a plane.
people think you might be sick.
this sunday?
the bread is in the cabinet.
this steak has too much fat.
they probably wouldn't like that.
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery.
beer is a powerful drug.
"yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors."
i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.
people take care of their lawns.
i didn't do anything.
they say they want change.
i would love to catch a movie this weekend.
swiss.
"i mean, keep your belongings close to you."
"well, someone brought it into the house."
"i don't know. whenever the weather comes on, i switch channels."
i'll do that in a minute.
i wish i could move here.
i'm falling asleep on the phone.
that's the way cats are.
the league suspended him for 50 games.
i liked it.
you mean like tiger?
"oh, yes, i took him there yesterday. he showed me one that he really liked."
"yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car."
"i know, it does sound pretty awesome."
maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
they were on sale for $80.
why are you yawning?
and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
people need to cover their trash cans.
"yes, about $7 million."
i learned back in high school.
a gardening show follows a knitting show.
okay. i just put a stamp on the envelope.
"i'm absolutely lovely, thank you."
"i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset."
the city is buying guns.
i think it was about 45 minutes long.
sunday is mother's day.
look at these marks on my arms.
working.
where did you go?
i drove around for half an hour.
"number five, it's unsafe."
"yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside."
sometimes i wish i was back in school.
it looks like blood.
"yes, it's covered with crud."
then you flew back home that evening?
is that what you really think?
not yet. it's been a week.
stress causes your stomachaches?
"no, when i call him on his cell phone."
are you going to be buried next to each other?
"i'm thinking, but i still have to go."
we can kill two birds with one stone.
i want it to cool down some.
"i mean, it's just coffee."
it was hot and sunny every day.
because i love the snow.
they should have kid reporters.
i didn't have to. it's been in business for 60 years.
the nation is switching to digital tv.
"it sure is, but i'm going to call hp first, just to make sure."
nobody told me.
what does she look like?
why? i'm watching the original.
you missed a really good game.
they pay money to play this silly game!
"what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes."
did you take it to a computer shop?
what do you mean?
i don't think i want to go to your heaven.
my wife left me.
our kids are completely safe.
i really wasn't told anything.
i wonder what he'll name it.
what happened?
that's disgusting.
"i'm sure i'll like it, too."
"well, be glad you're not a pilot."
"yes. when we landed, tv reporters and the army band were there."
i don't smell bad.
sunday means we go to church.
"all right, so i'll see you then."
"nope, and it drives him crazy."
"no, it's too close to the kitchen door."
that's a good idea.
you haven't told me anything yet.
what reason do you have for missing school?
it's not even 10 o'clock.
"i don't know, maybe one hundred."
he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
which one?
what's the matter with the produce?
"it was, until one day my manager caught me."
maybe it's something in your diet.
no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
you would float into the sky like a balloon.
we watch people walk by with their dogs.
but you'll be asleep in about one minute.
don't you think it's nice out?
why didn't you go before we left?
you can wear this one around the house.
we get a free breakfast.
so what's the problem?
and?
that's what i thought.
"no, i'm looking for another family."
that saves a lot of money.
why not?
"well, it was nice talking to you."
"all it takes is will power, and you have it."
if only i was talented.
i would never want to be president.
"that would be nice, thank you."
"if his wife doesn't mind, you shouldn't mind."
thank you.
then wait till you find a tissue.
she asked you about your pineapples?
you're kidding.
but that's impossible.
you can yell at them.
they shouldn't even call it news.
i'll teach you one.
everyone wants you to solve their problems.
i bought lots of oranges and apples.
i have a honda.
that was a huge fire in santa barbara.
that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.
"no, it's a taste you have to get used to."
it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
of course.
it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
"they are clean, too."
"that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water."
i never miss the food and drink section.
wow! that's terrible.
i bought some stock.
i don't know how that store makes money.
i'd better see you there.
her mom is a great cook.
i think i left the water running.
is it easy to learn?
that was my favorite class.
i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
you can yell at them.
that sounds like fun.
"well, my english isn't perfect."
what's the matter with it?
"yes, old people don't smell like fruit."
i was writing a letter.
but you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking!
they are bites.
what about the pillowcases?
we should really hang out again.
"well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems."
i sent them an email asking for my money back.
"still, it's safer than florida."
i hate going to parties.
does it have a price tag?
i guess so.
the world needs more polite people like us.
you can say that again.
are your nails clean?
"i am very sorry, but i must go."
i haven't been better. how about yourself?
"without gravity, the water would go up."
"well, superbad is super funny."
your nose is stopped up?
they say he's going 80 miles per hour.
that's hard to take.
it's my mom's dog.
have you looked in the mirror?
forget it. go straight.
but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!
it's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
do you smell that?
what race is he?
i had to. i was missing you a lot.
that was nice of you.
it's the funniest movie that i've ever seen.
there's at least one huge accident every day.
or we can go to the ocean.
would you have dinner with me?
"yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old."
i'm getting married.
she says they're good watchdogs.
"you should be happy, not worried."
"it really does, i can't wait."
we each get five cards.
"i'm not being nosey, it's just a question."
let me look at our list.
i can't wait till i grow up.
"no, it's too close to the front door."
good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
it's not orange!
then we'll just make a u-turn.
"no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october."
your day was just like mine.
is pasadena a big city?
i didn't even have lunch.
sometimes i want to throw it out the window.
he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
never park your car under a tree.
use a tissue next time.
so did i.
"well, you'd better get her something."
i'm going to call you soon. 
they want 20 percent down.
"okay, mom, maybe i was picking it a little bit."
i've never been to a french restaurant.
"well, it's good and bad."
"we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears."
i didn't want to pay for the holes.
so do i.
do you change the oil?
you can't see the end of it.
"well, you'd better get her something."
let me think a minute.
you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
can't they eat grass?
i was scratching my nose.
did you call the repairman?
she's cute.
don't be nosey.
do you want me to wake you in an hour?
that's what everyone says.
is this table okay?
that sounds good.
i feel like chinese.
i don't know. it's not my mud.
"yes, it will only take about 30 minutes."
"then i add butter, salt, and pepper."
what happened?
we don't do anything.
how long have you known how to do that?
a man i met in a coffee shop.
we'll never go there again.
"my boss offered me a promotion, and i took it."
why are they doing this?
it's not in my wallet.
"no, my sister and i will travel together."
"every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much."
"while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food."
"no, i don't like nose drops."
why did she leave you?
someone should set him on fire.
only a threat?
is that right. who ended up winning?
"i really wanted you to come, but i understand."
you know i don't like crowds.
"oh yes, you did."
coffee and a roll?
i thought you just bought a pair.
"did you see ""titanic""?"
"well, it gives me money, but it's my own money."
there will be another show next week.
is there a reason why?
i wish i was really smart.
"if my hard drive crashes, i'll just call you."
i love all their songs.
i think that would be nice.
then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in.
can they take their belongings?
i got them for forty.
what happened at the restaurant?
i don't really want to.
it was a great game.
i hope i come back as a cat.
"yes, i have."
the husband said he tried to help the boy.
paper is flying everywhere.
why is that?
i forgot.
"yes, but a puppy needs shots."
"but, mom, i'm not dirty."
paper cuts can hurt a lot.
then i did my laundry.
i've enjoyed conversing with you.
artists see things differently.
it seems that it may rain today.
dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
she's kind of short.
do you know why i pulled you over?
who ever heard of such a thing?
it's perfect for us and the kids.
because i love the snow.
"yes, it's very dirty."
"if you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too."
"you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes."
it gets worse every year.
why is that?
"yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside."
i bet you had to drag him away.
i loved it!
did he sign it?
get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
i've got a date for you.
is that a lot of work?
i'll get our fishing rods.
i drove around for half an hour.
that's not a bad idea.
next time i will be more careful.
of course.
i must not use this finger until the cut heals.
then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
have you heard from them?
what's that?
because i'll never find one for such a low price.
what are they paying?
speaking. what's up?
a great burger and great service.
maybe you can come next time.
it sure isn't.
"well, that's okay."
that sounds like fun. let's do it.
that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like?
berries aren't in season all year round.
"nothing much, what's going on?"
i wish it was a nicer day today.
but a house is so expensive.
what store did you get it from?
a blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
"so, will you be at school tomorrow?"
no. that's incomplete.
thank you very much.
what movie are you and your friend planning on watching?
"she got an ""everything"" job!"
i really hope it rains today.
how many best friends do you have?
did he say what time?
i think we'll be there in half an hour.
how about a dictionary?
he's a good speaker.
"i enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes."
i'm going to the movies with a friend. how about you?
why not?
i think that those are some really nice shoes. what kind are they?
a luxury car.
i really want to go to the movies this weekend.
i vacuumed the entire house.
what are you going to do about your death?
thanks. i found these new shoes earlier at the store.
i think i'll make a sandwich.
i'm worried.
"me, too. school was fun."
i didn't have time to get one from there.
"that's how i feel, i want winter to come soon."
i do it every once in a while.
where does cheese come from?
"oh, i don't care. you're the one who wants to go out."
it doesn't work.
you missed a really good game.
i hope i win the lotto.
i love boiled peanuts.
especially for drivers of big trucks.
but most of those hurricanes are harmless.
turn on the light.
you got up real early.
i was not looking at her.
obama's got four years to make everyone happy.
he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
it's okay.
"456 cherry drive, pasadena, ca 91170."
because you'll have an accident. most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
that's what made it so great.
"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers."
he said he wasn't using drugs.
"just lettuce, tomato, and celery."
i hate homework.
hold your breath till we get there.
that's because they cook it while you wait.
nothing.
i love most how it is at night after it rains.
i like the different instruments that they use.
"i didn't want to, so i didn't."
"four hours, without a break."
he stayed on the thirteenth floor.
"after that, we can dry it with a towel."
teaching is the best part of my whole day.
that sounds delicious.
you can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
"no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little."
why do you do that?
"what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?"
i guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
can't you take medicine or something for it?
i'm going to be a teacher.
okay. teach me how to play.
that wasn't very nice of her.
of course not! he's family.
that takes some time.
there were more votes than voters!
excuse me. they just called my number.
let's go jogging.
"maybe the room is nice, but not the bed."
i'm taking a math course in school.
how were you sick?
"yes, but the red hand was blinking."
what's the matter with it?
and now i'm glad that i didn't.
which movie is your favorite to watch?
"no, i'm serious."
who said there is a problem with her?
you hit a white ball.
that's a lot of work.
i'm having dinner with my family
they like guys with new cars.
"sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't."
where are all these people going?
they are the best musical group ever.
about what?
are you going to college?
i'm going to clean it.
i don't like it reheated.
what kind of cheese?
many shirts come with an extra button.
you are coming?
how about some potato chips?
he will solve our problems.
what did you do?
i really love how rain clears the air.
plus installation?
where do you want to go?
did someone steal it?
so do i.
the travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount!
i'm not being nosey. i'm just asking.
wasn't there anything about octo-mom?
oh.
"you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes."
so maybe he'll go to jail forever?
"if more people donate money, pbs could offer new shows."
i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.
this time they have charged him with murder.
i'm throwing a party on friday.
three pounds just this month.
our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.
sounds like it was a close game.
"you think so, how come?"
"with toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice."
do you believe the tv ads?
you're supposed to stay home all day.
so what did he tell you to do?
i was looking at something else.
do you want to go fishing?
why not?
don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
how long did it take?
is it his money?
baseball is fun.
"no, i was crossing the street."
what are you doing?
so maybe he'll go to jail forever?
but i need something that's reliable.
i wouldn't do that.
why not?
what kind?
of course i will.
"yes, he was on the tv news today."
"no, i was crossing the street."
you need a car with low mileage.
i don't have enough will power.
let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
what interests you in that type of music?
"well, listen to it more quietly."
"i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see."
"well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air."
"well, i think you look nice today too."
the people are friendly.
really? i got mine from her this morning.
did you yell at them?
i saw it twelve times.
"hello, may i speak to alice please?"
"me, too."
i really like that outfit.
did you write a letter to grandma?
a flag should be pretty.
i don't want to date a blind woman.
"""mi"" stands for middle initial."
"my dad went to washington, d.c."
"i know, you're absolutely right."
they will. you know america always leads the way.
it sure is windy today.
"oh, look. here's the little sticker that was on it. it's called a pink navel."
i don't really like parties.
"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone."
that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.
why is that?
me too.
"well, she's quite short."
where are you going to school?
what are we waiting for?
someone stole his laptop.
why not?
"so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt."
fine.
they're best when they're hot.
did you use a new blade?
how long was the flight?
a button came off my shirt.
obama's got four years to make everyone happy.
it's only 10 minutes from here.
why was that?
but the same thing day after day gets old.
"yes, i think he did."
that's rude.
i switched from pasta to potatoes.
why's that?
what did you say?
poetry sucks.
so we've got to sell before property values go down?
how did we end up in that terrible hotel?
i absolutely love what you're wearing today.
that's all right.
"yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year."
"yes, there is."
we should hang out some time.
what have you been doing?
do you think i'll forget to do it?
so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.
can you make it?
our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.
"i'm absolutely lovely, thank you."
i know. i went to china yesterday.
any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.
"that's nice, but tell me what she looks like."
he helped make the yankees the best team ever.
winter is great. i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
they're all asking the same question.
"i know, you should really go and see her and the baby."
what else do they talk about?
to try something new and exciting.
i have to check the stove.
"yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down."
that was a long time ago.
who invented flossing?
debrah already had her baby.
pimples suck.
i didn't know that.
i can't stand cigarette smoke.
they only cost me about forty dollars.
do you see all this gray hair? it was totally black five years ago.
put on a coat and tie.
i always put cheese in my salads.
"whatever the reason may be, i'm glad you visited me."
no. they can only give a ticket if they see it happen.
would you have dinner with me?
"i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see."
i think only the family will be there.
you can watch tv after you do your homework.
what happened?
i have to walk the dog.
i don't want to see a movie by myself.
i care. do something.
do they talk about us?
"this friday? sorry, i already have plans."
what's the point?
am i going to see you there?
"to the city, of course."
"yes, i took them off the pillows and washed them."
"tell me about it, dad."
it got rained out.
"no, he won't. some cars are doing 85."
"yes, but they never make much money."
so what were you calling me about?
none.
what else can you do?
"whatever a customer ordered, i sliced off a little more for me."
we never have to call the police about anything.
i hate to go outside.
i wasn't really feeling well.
a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs?
once every two months.
"well, i meant to."
i want to be a mail carrier when i grow up.
it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.
you shouldn't make him wait.
where are the seats?
it was the best game ever.
"oh, no you don't. puppies don't eat vegetables."
i'm an open book. watch me all you want.
"whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot."
i think that it's going to rain.
i hate shaving.
i missed you too.
"no, it isn't. a flat costs you time and money."
how long did it take?
i like to see actors who are like real people.
i love most how it is at night after it rains.
me too.
i like to hit the ball.
i'm taking a math course in school.
no. i'll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.
do you believe everything you hear?
i have no idea. all of a sudden i heard your siren.
the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
you're right.
that is true. i hope it doesn't rain.
i promise i'll never drink out of the carton again.
can they take their belongings?
how can i prove it?
"it's in the fridge, i think."
you're not going to be buried?
it's always good to have friends.
they forget who put them in power.
i think that would be nice.
my hard drive crashed.
every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
"one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce."
"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard."
you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
of course you are. you ate everything on the table.
i told her that school is fun.
maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
now it's like riding a bus.
 it doesn't matter. here he comes now with the mop.
"okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner."
what would you like to see?
that would be weird.
did you have to blow right next to the phone?
did you go swimming?
i turned up the volume.
why do you like it?
but work goes on forever!
so how do you think positive?
you should unplug the phone.
you're right. this one does have an extra button.
i have it on dvd at my house if you want to come over and watch it.
nothing really.
i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
yes. all my life.
let's go out to eat.
"yes, it's better to get there too early than too late."
i think there are more fish.
did you put the letter in an envelope?
maybe the banana was bad.
isn't it a nice day?
did you always know how to draw and paint?
what do you mean?
don't vacuum it now.
not me. i want to play for the dodgers.
why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour.
did you take some sort of art class or something?
"so do i, but i'm worried."
everyone wants you to solve their problems.
people who live in hawaii are lucky.
"every so often, i do."
"well, that's cool."
"yes, it was pleasant."
"a speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl."
is it in northern california?
"well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?"
how far away is it?
maybe i will be the first!
lunch was delicious.
i didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.
how tall would you say that she is?
i think they do.
i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
is it raining right now?
"oh, look. here's another shirt just like it."
i'd rather be cold than hot.
you're kidding. you might get killed.
she laughed! she didn't believe me.
i want to do something tomorrow with you.
i loved it. i want to live there.
i think they're nuts.
it has great weather all year long.
get out of this lane.
especially on a hot day like this.
she's got a great personality.
what article?
i'm going to the movie theater with my friend. what are you going to do?
"yes, it will only take about 30 minutes."
"without the food stains, it would probably be worth more."
they talk about other animals.
maybe we should honk the horn next time.
i tell my students to become a teacher.
i hope so. i love to eat fish.
cats have beautiful eyes.
"no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now."
"but, mom!"
i have no idea. i've been here for 20 years.
i hope you feel better.
"oh, yes! ""let it be, let it beÂ…"""
"he can, but the people around him can't."
"he was invited, along with about 90 other veterans."
i'm throwing a party on friday.
"yes, except this dent will cost about $150."
what type of music do you like to listen to?
he had dirty fingernails.
check your tires or you'll get a flat.
my dad had to buy a new car.
of course. but i don't have cable.
"me, too. i love them roasted and salted."
"okay, until next time then."
how much have you gained?
i use a calling card.
that tasted so good.
maybe she's different.
how much is that?
i thought you had a job.
i'm still feeling under the weather.
what are you talking about?
i enjoy drawing and painting.
that's terrible. i hope they catch the person.
what do you want the waiter to do?
"only about $30,000."
are you sure?
"if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course."
why did they ever let him out?
"yes, it was pleasant."
it might as well be me.
pimples suck.
once every two months.
did the seller know that?
how easy is that?
"no, i don't. do you?"
i was thinking of driving to arizona.
"yeah, maybe next time."
"i like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."
okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.
but it won't stop other players from using drugs.
but the show will be over.
i'd better see you there.
what was wrong with you?
see those stains?
what do you need five of them for?
what do you mean?
tell me what you've been doing.
they want tax cuts.
i got laid off because there was no work.
see you then. goodbye.
can i pick you up friday night?
how many rich people do you know?
you're kidding. you might get killed.
the next four years will be good years.
i feel sorry for you.
it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.
"let me see. yes, you're right. your orange is pink."
"so, forget it."
i go to pasadena city college.
i don't have long distance service with my home phone.
it's more like news for kids.
all they think about is themselves.
they were about forty dollars.
it's called poker.
that was a nice funeral.
it'll get worse before it gets better.
"i have no idea, she hasn't given out many though."
except we can't afford it!
i stayed home because i wasn't feeling well.
and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
i'm glad you don't complain very much.
you like to see it disappear.
i'm going to give them away. do you want one?
they hope they will go to heaven.
of course. we can't live without gas or peanut butter.
describe her to me.
you're joking.
most people would say that.
let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
is it raining right now?
do they talk about us?
at night i went out to eat. the food was delicious.
"well, you're supposed to be working."
maybe we can go see a movie or something.
she's about five feet even.
"finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground."
why did she do that?
i see that you're pretty talented.
i'm having a party this friday.
i think that i might.
i wasn't able to attend school because i was feeling ill.
"well, just call the front desk. they'll give us new sheets."
what's the matter with the produce?
it certainly is.
i need a new computer.
you think they won't fit?
i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
you speak two languages.
now they're adding old tv shows to the old movies.
"that's nice, have you been to the movies lately?"
that's a good price.
it's your girlfriend's fault. she should have warned you.
i've been missing you like crazy.
do you want to do something tomorrow?
maybe. what is she like?
do you listen to the radio?
"yes, i saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters."
i'll say! i've gone around the world a dozen times already!
"he might relax, but it makes me nervous."
the score was 101-98.
it's on the corner.
i would've thought that somebody would have told you.
"i read it once, and i subscribed."
"it's not too much, only about $85."
so what's the problem?
"well, i guess you have to live with it."
"neither do i, but they're doing something right."
did you get free food?
a pc or a mac?
what were you doing?
that's such a hassle.
maybe you should use an electric shaver.
how much money does he give away?
even if it's only for a short while.
i will rub gently but firmly.
i am going to see a movie with a friend of mine. what about you?
i bought you a pair of pants.
who knows? they said they'll fix it before next season.
a third guy punched one of the two guys.
what are you going to do?
you don't need a job. i make enough money for both of us.
"oh, well, it only cost me a dollar."
are there more fish or more people?
so?
not sure. is there a movie out that catches your eye?
we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
"yeah, you should have. it was really exciting."
eight o'clock.
that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
but i have rabbit ears.
why did he do that?
"let me look. no, it's not there."
you should take a break.
i'm upset with my mom.
i'm not in the mood.
don't be nosey.
it's the best job i've ever had.
what are you talking about?
"i think i know, because this happened before."
i was laughing through the whole movie.
he should act his age.
you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
i'm not sure yet.
i don't care. i don't like to put drops in my nose.
that's such a hassle.
a car that was owned by a little old lady.
"first of all, he was half an hour late."
we won't have any money for other things?
"oh, a laptop, of course."
it's six years old.
"it has about 140,000 people."
what about her facial features?
you have to believe in yourself.
did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
i enjoy listening to both rock and r&b.
i believe so.
i want to go to see a movie this weekend.
i think that's an excellent reason to like something.
i don't know.
he made promises that he didn't keep.
the home run hitter on drugs?
"yes, i would love one."
i sure am.
when is he coming?
"we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears."
you and everybody else.
you know what i'm talking about.
did you see the waiter's hands?
"oh, yes! ""let it be, let it beÂ…"""
maybe you're right.
how about some potato chips?
"well, they do put their party before their country."
i'm going to clean it.
are you interested?
eight.
that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like?
let's play cards.
someone should set him on fire.
thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever.
only a threat?
i don't want to go alone.
every easter sunday he gives away money.
"well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual."
he knows you can't read his mind. maybe he thinks you're cheating.
why didn't you take a nap when you got home?
put your seatbelt on.
"for example, a friend of mine licks his lips."
did you yell at them?
me too. french dressing is so delicious! who cares about calories?
you should take a break.
"i don't think so. after i finish, i'll have enough money to go to college."
i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
maybe i left the burner on.
how easy is that?
nothing seems to work.
"i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one of mine."
"maybe it was, but answer the question."
i haven't heard anything about it.
but i'm listening to it.
it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!
we also get leather.
that's a good question. maybe it's not old age.
is that right?
why would i date someone i don't even know?
you're crazy.
i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.
why do you like that type of music?
you look really nice today. 
"she raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?"
i was doing my homework.
do you ever pray for money?
"yes, but she looks like a man."
no problem. i'll give him food off my plate.
then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.
doesn't crime cost more than police?
is that right?
"well, superbad is super funny."
what do they talk about?
people are always getting up to use the bathroom.
really? how many do you have?
but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?
you can watch tv after you do your homework.
i'll have to try them sometime.
i wish i had never started.
that doesn't make it right.
so tell me the final score.
i'll say.
not a lot. what about you?
he's busy. he said next week.
i got a ticket yesterday.
thank you.
what's the matter?
what do you mean?
the light is on.
"wear a jacket, too."
because you'll have an accident. most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
did she catch you using drugs?
"basically, i've been working too."
"yes, but i was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb."
i sure hope not.
someone who slips could hurt their back.
it's the automatic teller machine.
"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes."
i didn't have a tissue.
you're jammed in with people all around you.
"so, why haven't you visited me?"
that's for sure.
have you heard what happened?
"i read it once, and i subscribed."
he didn't give you any medication?
so are mine.
don't be ridiculous.
"first, i have to find the button."
remind me to never visit you.
yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
they added phony charges to our bill.
what have you been doing?
so do i.
but that's what most people do.
how many tires were cut?
"yes, he was smoking a cigarette."
when did he die?
i'm throwing a party next saturday.
some people would just pick it up.
and they were expensive houses.
okay. i'll return your pen when i'm done.
fine. what's going on with you?
a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
"well, i hope it has a happy ending."
and it's just as easy to prepare.
how could that be?
see you later.
why don't you look outside?
she told him to drop his girlfriend.
do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
of course they match.
to the state or the city?
the cat doesn't care about anything.
i love that show.
"yes, if they do it quickly."
"no, i was in the crosswalk."
of course. he stops the fastest cars.
i think i've put on some weight.
it's almost empty.
who were you writing to?
i love to eat the peanuts.
some private organization.
what happened?
no one at work likes him.
"boy, that's a tough one."
okay. it looks like rain.
"no, we won't have money for gas or food."
no.
i won't be able to play with the kids.
it's always good to have friends.
i don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.
"tell me about it, dad."
but it's uncomfortable.
it was really nice talking to you also.
i haven't even lost one pound of fat?
then why aren't i having fun?
did you see the woman with the new face?
but it's uncomfortable.
they still make movies like that.
they're all so cute.
my pen is out of ink.
you have got to be talented.
it's only 10 minutes from here.
i don't know. i just woke up.
"number four, it's too crowded."
do pimples run in your family?
what about the other homeless people?
they still make movies like that.
the cat doesn't care about anything.
and watch your dvd.
you think?
i am too.
that is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music.
of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet.
what was your problem?
what about the unfriendly dogs?
of course. what else?
then we went to a jazz club.
but there are a lot of police.
"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee."
why's that?
"yeah, sorry."
i don't know.
sure. why not?
i don't think so.
"yes, just in english alone."
"so we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?"
i add some pepper and salt.
i'll use a damp cloth.
why do you hate to go outside?
you should bring some wipes with you.
thank you. i just bought these new shoes earlier today.
it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
you like to see it disappear.
what are we going to do?
what happened to your plans?
"well, nobody else does, so why should i?"
"i've heard about it, but i'm still waiting for my invitation."
"and the pickles were great, too."
i learned back in high school.
i hope we'll catch a foul ball.
"i will chop your toes off, one by one."
what's the matter?
there's no sugar or cream in it.
where are the band-aids?
"i'm serious, have you?"
cigarette lighters. i'll make a fortune.
"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat."
"also, there aren't enough police."
i really wasn't told anything.
i mean i have wonderful students.
it smells so bad.
i know that.
but work goes on forever!
"it hurts, too."
you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
it sure is.
i hate flossing more than brushing!
how do you know?
we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
the son gave a nice speech about his father.
he's rude and he yells a lot.
he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
how about this table?
it's about crime in los angeles.
i'd better see you there.
this steak has too much fat.
what's the matter?
you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
it was new in 2003.
"like ""one, two, buckle my shoe."""
"yes, dad, it was."
"no, the police don't care."
you don't solve a problem by shooting it.
but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
"i'm sorry, but i have to go."
i can't get a single channel.
i really missed you a lot.
my girlfriend and i sit outside starbucks.
"yeah, i think so too."
i made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.
what are you talking about?
"but someone's going to break it, so what good is it?"
i hope you kept the receipt.
i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
"we will be house rich, but cash poor."
have you tried nose drops?
and you get a lot of exercise every day.
"if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god."
you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
"the sandwich was good, too."
was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
do you have any other skills?
"this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?"
coffee and a roll?
you have got to be talented.
the sports guy shows us players fighting.
no problem.
"yeah, let's do that."
i mixed them together.
there are a lot of poor people in new york.
"yes, it starts at 7 p.m."
"yes, they are."
that's exactly how i felt.
i didn't do anything.
what is your favorite kind of music?
not yet.
just wait until you're 50 years old.
are there any hobbies you do?
everything's been good with you?
"well regardless, i'm very happy that you came to see me."
you eat too much chocolate.
don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
i think most jokes are about women.
do you feel better now?
i have to be there two hours early.
i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
"yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?"
"oh, yes. i wash it once a week."
why not?
but you eat fruits.
"well, you should do something that you enjoy."
it's about crime in los angeles.
what happened?
what's for dinner?
it was love at first sight?
let's go to your home.
i have to hang up. i'm so sleepy.
"you're probably right, do you intend on going to the party?"
"well, i know how to flip hamburgers."
so what were you calling me about?
"they always make ""what's next"" sound exciting, but it never is."
i ate free cheese and meat every day.
i think i've put on some weight.
maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
i like the kinds of instruments that they use.
i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
so we've got to sell before property values go down?
why didn't you take a nap when you got home?

"no, today people like lots of action."
no. it's in southern california.
look! he just hit that car.
i want to. i heard it's going to be really fun.
"yes, i guess most of us are stuck in a routine."
are you even going to go?
we get a free breakfast.
i thought it was next sunday.
who's paying for that?
sunday means we go to church.
yes. it is a great movie.
so am i.
"yes, the snow is fun."
i'm doing well. how about you?
yes. i remember this big tree.
this hot bread is delicious.
"no, i always back up my files."
i don't know any card games.
"yes, i know. some people are rude."
"yeah, i went. did you go?"
"oh, really? i think most jokes are about men!"
"oh, i just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow."
why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
"yeah, you should have. it was really exciting."
a tree fell onto my dad's car.
what have you been doing?
it's not bad. there are a lot of people there.
i didn't have time to get one from there.
a girl i met at the market.
but i need something that's reliable.
he landed on the hood of the car.
i really wish i went to the game.
i hate shots.
let's go to the lake.
"no, the white walk sign was blinking."
he said he wasn't using drugs.
"clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet."
no. they said there are some things you can't explain.
what time does it start?
of course.
so she likes poodles.
did you hear that?
they were in the student parking lot.
sure.
did you need something?
do you think you can come?
it doesn't look very nice outside today.
how long did it take?
i think i know the difference between picking and scratching.
me too. they canceled their other news magazines.
are you sure?
sounds good. what did you have in mind?
"yes, we do."
boiled? i never heard of that.
people talk about current events.
that's correct.
you never know what might happen on these freeways.
what about the other homeless people?
but his latest fire killed someone.
you haven't told me anything yet.
the car isn't here.
and it's just as easy to prepare.
why is that?
i think i'll buy both of them.
but i stopped!
of course they lieÂ—that's what politicians do!
it was a great game.
"yes, i looked there, too."
have you gone to school today?
people stood in line just to get one dollar?!
did you hear the good news?
just you?
so?
that sounds nice.
i haven't looked anywhere yet.
sure.
because you get to meet a lot of people.
i really want to go to the movies this weekend.
"oh, really? maybe you should have called 911."
have you told her?
last year we made a big snowman.
i'm looking in the newspaper for a job.
i feel like chinese.
"if we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell."
i haven't lately.
"what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?"
it's not too big.
"yes, cheese is nice."
what was your problem?
wait till it dries. it will be easier to vacuum.
"no problem, you're welcome."
during the christmas holidays.
i certainly hope not!
i thought you had an elephant in your house.
i always read the film reviews.
it gives you money?
what article?
are you serious?
it's perfect for us and the kids.
i filled up my freezer with ice cream.
"yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution."
i bought some new shoes.
you should see a doctor.
you know what that means.
you sure do.
did you check all your pockets?
true. predictable weather would make life easier.
a third guy punched one of the two guys.
that must be nice.
i'm sorry. i'm already doing something this friday.
"$1,000."
"yes, that will occur next month."
"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee."
what do you want to do?
this trail is hard to climb.
was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
me too. there are no guarantees.
so do i.
then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
the one that stole a small plane?
are you going to start a family?
shakespeare was a poet.
and it gives you money?
and they will yell back at you.
i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
all i get is a black screen.
of course it was. we work together!
what do you mean?
i hate flying.
"exactly, it was my favorite class."
it starts at 8 o'clock.
it was nice talking to you too.
"the usual, cereal with milk and a banana."
what's the matter with this one?
i'm not interested in her.
how come?
"what does ""mi"" mean?"
what's that?
they're all asking the same question.
"first you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers."
i think i'm going to go buy myself a pair.
"i've tried everything, but nothing works."
you're right. the buses are never on time.
"some of it is okay, i guess."
i hope i come back as a cat.
that doesn't matter. i don't want to sit around.
until then.
i think i'm going to explode.
don't mention it.
so are they going to hold another election?
it's one dollar for 100 minutes.
dogs are like peopleÂ—not all of them are friendly.
what time?
of course.
i guess they haven't read this article.
that's ridiculous!
maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
about finding a job for me.
"i'll bet he was drinking, too."
so how do you plan to become rich?
he's been in jail three times already.
my parents are divorced.
what did you buy?
i bought it on a hunch.
what's wrong with it?
what are you going to do?
why?
take me to dinner.
why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
they're very comfortable.
what did you say? i think i've gone deaf.
"it was long, too."
go do your homework.
"oh, my goodness. no one is safe on the streets."
sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.
i hope they fit.
sometimes i want to throw it out the window.
i want to buy lunch.
and then we can go to my home.
"yeah, but i'm still waiting for my invitation."
that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
"oh, yes, i really like it."
they go in one ear and out the other.
i will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick.
"oh, no. that's bad news."
why would he do that?
they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.
my waist is bigger than it was.
"well, the tables and chairs look okay."
i used to work in a deli.
so many people are out of work.
that means it will get hotter.
"what does ""mm/dd/yy"" mean?"
or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
has she given out a lot of invitations yet?
i've tried to quit so many times.
"everybody loved him, all over the nation."
"yes, rained out."
me too. that movie brought tears to my eyes.
maybe we're here to have fun.
"maybe i'll vote for someone else, too."
do you know what movie you're going to watch?
there are other things i need to take care of.
that hotel was terrible.
you don't want to do that.
then why can't i quit?
thanks for coming to see me today.
are there going to be layoffs at this place?
our team won 101-98.
i haven't seen her yet.
i'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose. i'll be right back.
it's only a couple of feet.
it's too much like other flags.
someday the bomb is going to be for real.
the cat is meowing. he's hungry.
don't use water on it!
that sounds like fun. where do you want to go?
i don't know which one i like the best.
when you go to church?
it looks like it may rain soon.
"maybe i know, but how could you know?"
"well, thank you. i hope to see you at school tomorrow."
eat the fruit. it's good for you.
i'll put on my cap.
"you don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna."
i took the dog for a walk.
are you going to be there?
i've been coming here for years.
"i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you."
debrah had her baby last week.
you had an art class?
"no, it's too close to the kitchen door."
i got laid off last week.
and you get to play with a lot of dogs.
"i'm sorry, i can't."
especially the metal ones.
i agree. work is just as hard as school.
that's good to hear.
i folded all the towels.
i was not looking at her.
we have to practice every day.
i wonder if every language has jokes.
because he likes to scuba dive.
"that would be great, then we could plan things sooner."
"i really don't know, but i don't think she gave out that many yet."
"all it takes is will power, and you have it."
of course. i have lots of best friends.
"yes, there is."
because of all the security?
"yes, but i don't know where the orange cones are."
and i have to take care of our children.
no one makes any money at it.
"yes, a lot of flags have stripes."
they say that we are funny-looking.
i didn't have a tissue.
but what if i'm a fish in my next life?
they talk about other animals.
it really is.
"sure, let's go."
so are cigarettes.
i think most jokes are about women.
me too.
i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.
is it something you ate?
have a nice nap.
which would you prefer?
read the phone number to me.
"""she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!..."""
i'm going to take a nap.
i know that we need milk.
but i am a good driver. i've never had a ticket in my life.
i don't think i'm going to dream about anything. i'm really tired.
we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
you started eating ice cream?
i got laid off last week.
i think i lost it today. i used it yesterday.
thanks for telling me.
"and the rooms are clean, too."
it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.
ahora! that means right now.
i thought you knew.
"not a lot, what about you?"
then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
what's wrong with the bed?
so why are we selling our house?
that sounds like fun. where do you want to go?
can we get tickets?
i saw you looking at that woman.
i'll hold you to that.
the invitation says it starts at 8:00 p.m.
yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.
now all you have to do is sew it on.
and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
once in a while is once too many.
how much is that?
your nose is stopped up?
we'll have fresh fish for dinner!
"yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers."
"in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining."
every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
i can't believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.
why? we're already late.
so you have seen her around?
do you like this house?
she weighs 98 pounds.
"so, what do we do?"
he's never going to make everyone happy.
then why is there mud on the carpet?
it shouldn't take him long to fix it.
maybe you should use an electric shaver.
what's this stain?
"they don't work, either."
he apologized to the fans.
"oh, really? that's nice."
paper cuts can hurt a lot.
i was busy doing something. i apologize.
how did you get it?
"like what, for instance?"
i'm trying to stretch my dollars.
i'll go.
what do you do?
that's for sure.
but i love pizza.
that's what made it so great.
how do you know?
i wanted to see if you wanted to come.
i'll have to try them sometime.
why did your parents get divorced?
the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
my fingers hurt.
that's a good reason to like something.
winter is great. i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.
did the seller know that?
"they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it."
i don't know which one i like the best.
what do you listen to?
"oh, yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital."
we can be there in 20 minutes.
what are you going to do with an english major?
"i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter."
"well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces."
"yes, it's just a couple of screws."
what are you going to do?
"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court."
someone who slips could hurt their back.
he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
don't they clean the bus every night?
no doubt.
how did they survive in the old days?
look in the fridge.
i hope they are fast minutes.
just hold on.
some people have good noses.
i want you to clean the bathroom.
it comes from cows.
i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
they're in the kitchen drawer.
of course i will.
where were the cars?
she would laugh at me.
one hundred!
and then you chase it.
she would laugh at me.
and it was only 12 years.
yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
someone had to chop the wood.
what did they do in the old days?
"yes, you chased me and then you caught me."
i really have to go.
what do you mean?
i don't know.
"oh, no, you don't."
how much money do you have?
"for example, if your birth date is january 12, 1987, write 01/12/87."
i attended school today. did you?
that was mean to say.
i don't smell bad.
"yes, i did."
"yes, it does. it's only $20."
you mean like tiger?
i will keep knocking on doors.
"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too."
because of all the security?
that's what everyone says.
who did you vote for for president?
"so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything."
someone cut the tires.
why not?
"no, i don't. do you?"
i got it from macy's.
what about the baseball game?
"if i smelled bad, i could smell me."
"hey, what's up?"
that's no good!
you know the rules.
i mean you're wasting your life.
"oh, no. that's bad news."
but i'm worried about tiger.
i wish it would cool off one day.
do your socks match?
"that should be a nice trip. lots of fun, and lots of food."
it's worse than that.
how do you know?
"yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember."
what does she do?
"oh, really?"
i hate homework.
what did you have for breakfast?
i'm still feeling a little sick.
did the cat bite you?
it's okay. she knows that i love her.
i'm in a hurry.
turn on the air conditioner.
what race is he?
okay. here's seven pennies.
"no, that's not the problem."
the speed limit is 65!
hmm. here's an idea. put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.
"well, it won't last forever."
then you should watch the rerun.
why?
you should stop drinking coffee.
what's to check?
i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
where's the car?
really?
"but, mom!"
i don't understand some things.
i think they do.
i'm sorry to hear that. would you like the assignments from english class?
that one. the one that's all black.
any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.
i thought school was hard.
you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
i think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.
have you decided whether or not you would like to go?
but that's impossible.
do you ever pray for money?
so was i.
where do you get these crazy ideas?
look at all these kittens!
the tires on the cars.
florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.
there are fish at the top and the bottom.
are there fish at the bottom?
that was a long time ago.
"no, not recently."
look at these marks on my arms.
he moved out of our house.
we also get leather.
he swam right up to you.
he might say i'm okay.
he's a famous artist.
that would be fun.
"no, but my feet don't hurt anymore."
have you heard about jessica's party on saturday?
"no, i haven't."
that's true. where did that money go?
"you won't catch me, because i love you. i'm not a cheater."
what are you eating now?
it was like the real thing.
does god answer your prayers?
"i know he has a good hand, so i don't bet."
"yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals."
did you hear about the ball player?
i don't have even one dollar in it.
but we have the same old problems.
that's a lot of money.
what's wrong with it?
now he has the world record!
like what?
why don't you wash it?
have you seen a doctor?
what's a little blood?
what was the problem?
and then he turned right around.
the light is on.
"yes, the workers are very polite."
they added phony charges to our bill.
the streets and sidewalks are clean.
your white shirt is ruined.
that is a lot of friends. do you have a best friend?
how about you see a movie with me and my friend?
i like to see actors who are like real people.
maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
i really can't stand going to parties.
what's the matter?
i'm gaining weight.
maybe i left the burner on.
they never shut up.
you can say that again.
how soon can we begin?
"i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility."
i'm not interested in her.
i buried him with his cell phone.
"hey, did you hear about jessica's party this weekend?"
but it went by fast. it was interesting.
this city is full of jerks.
yes. i called for a clean-up.
i'm busy this friday. i'm sorry.
what's going on?
maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
i've always liked to draw and paint.
"i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself."
i hope so. i have to go to the bathroom.
our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
that means it gets twice as much traffic.
"no, thanks. i already took some medicine."
"no, i didn't feel like it."
really? what kind of shoes are they?
it should have a pretty woman on it.
where are you going to school?
"yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms."
"oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?"
i will knock on the doors of all the corporations.
and the government will give you a fourth story.
how big was it?
i read a lot.
"so, did you want to go?"
they both said i have to live with it.
what do they talk about?
i don't see anything.
"no, i haven't. why?"
a little cigarette controls them.
what were you doing?
she's probably about five feet.
how did you do that?
i couldn't find any stamps.
is that right?
he's the only candidate that i trust.
that's what i do.
have you attended school today?
there are lots of ugly men singers.
"what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes."
this is she. how's it going?
where do the students go?
you're right. this one does have an extra button.
you and everybody else.
"yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best."
will it be good beach weather?
i think stamps used to cost a penny.
no human can do that.
and he yelled back at me.
they say that we are funny-looking.
"well, you can't have everything."
and you're mine forever.
and there was no violence.
what did your father do?
"yes, it's just a couple of screws."
"well, it's good and bad."
i'm doing great. what about you?
why?
you didn't read about the company first?
"yes, they are."
get out of this lane.
how many cars?
i think stamps used to cost a penny.
and lots of thieves.
it's on right now. let's watch it together.
"he was invited, along with about 90 other veterans."
how do you like it?
ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
"no, when i call him on his cell phone."
people will tell you if they have a good hand.
"well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents."
"well, i've seen them eating berries."
tell me how she looks.
exactly what?
start typing instead. that way your left hand will do half the work.
this sunday?
what's wrong with the bed?
not even a church is safe from thieves.
do you have a girlfriend?
"yes, you chased me and then you caught me."
no problem. i'll give him food off my plate.
you have a lot of plants.
what does it mean?
why did you do that?
maybe he had a good reason.
what makes it so good?
i'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
"how big is ""pretty big""?"
"if you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals."
we'll stop at the next mcdonald's.
tell me you're joking.
"okay, what kind of job do you want?"
that's not the attitude of a good driver.
all we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.
why do they call it the good old days?
"yes, it's a $140 ticket."
now he has the world record!
you rolled through that stop sign back there.
those are great. how much were they?
then he didn't bother to apologize.
people take care of their lawns.
of course. we gave him a big carrot for a nose.
when did you learn how to do that?
which one?
i shook it. there is no more ink.
it will cost you only $20 plus parts.
will you look at this form?
"so, they do a good job for the money."
where does he travel to?
i think we should go out to eat.
i don't know any card games.
one or two tires were cut on each car.
i always put cheese in my salads.
"so, i'll just buy another one."
"of course, the cheese with holes in it."
"i still have my job, thank goodness."
i've got to go.
"no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left."
when did you get divorced?
"oh, yeah."
i appreciate that.
you might want to buy a pair.
"oh, you actually do that?"
so what was the score?
i don't know. look in the fridge.
i'm glad sunday is only once a week.
no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.
"oh, well, it only cost me a dollar."
i like to slide into the bases.
it might as well be me.
how come?
shakespeare was a poet.
i'm really glad that you came to see me.
"yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer."
how do you know that?
i don't understand.
what does it say?
i think it's five miles deep.
it was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
did it get any better?
i'll see you tomorrow then.
how much money do you have?
and i don't have either.
why did she do that?
i love cheese.
wasn't there anything about octo-mom?
how much have you gained?
cigarettes stink.
it puts me to sleep.
how did he do it?
"well, you're supposed to be working."
what about the unfriendly dogs?
i like to hit the ball.
my parents go to church every sunday.
like what?
"well, i guess that's a $20 lesson for you."
"the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know."
"i had a car problem, so i went online."
do you have a car?
i used all my savings on this one company.
why is it so slow?
that saves a lot of money.
i know a good chinese restaurant.
where are we going?
that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?
"yes, that sounds nice."
that's a great idea.
i really hope it doesn't get cold.
but you'll be asleep in about one minute.
"well, i guess that's why he did it."
i wish my eyes were blue.
"well, congratulations."
let's go to an early movie.
oh. of course i'm ready.
we'll grow old together.
"the next game, i will definitely be there."
sorry about that.
you put all your eggs into one basket.
that's very nice.
now a stamp is 42 cents.
what were you doing?
tell me about this patch.
"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen."
that isn't a good deal?
"every time we eat out, it's an adventure."
how big is los angeles?
"no, they smell like a thrift shop."
they also ate with their fingers!
let's go to church with your parents on sunday.
i went to macy's and picked it out.
so?
that's not nice.
i have it on dvd at my house if you want to come over and watch it.
it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.
i think they're in the medicine cabinet.
no. i'm divorced.
what do you mean?
i folded all the towels.
"well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m."
high school or middle school?
the digital signal is very clear.
"i did, but i have to go again."
i wonder if i should bring my gloves.
did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.?
"well, there's nothing wrong with that."
what do you mean?
how often do i have to do that?
and it was only 12 years.
"if i catch you, you'll be sorry."
i voted for ralph nader.
"yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?"
i like listening to different kinds of music.
that's very nice of you.
i'm not sure yet. is there something you want to see?
how far away is that?
why not?
it looks like it may rain soon.
what woman?
we have to find a cheaper house.
so what are you going to do?
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.
"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen."
"well, listen to it more quietly."
this looks like a nice table.
thank you. that's polite of you to ask.
i wasn't picking my nose.
you shouldn't make him wait.
i think it's the ice cream.
so why did you get a ticket?
you would do the same for me.
congratulations on your promotion.
"okay, i'm sorry i did it."
you sure do.
i like to run around the bases.
i'm attending pcc right now.
let me step outside and see.
but i stopped!
"only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas."
maybe the milk was bad.
golf is a silly game.
maybe we shouldn't complain.
i didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.
how can he do that?
is that right?
no.
why not?
let me get my camera.
it was tomato soup.
"yes, i think so too."
are you sure?
"he didn't get around to turning himself in, either."
they are the best musical group ever.
me too. i can't wait until winter.
computers are so cool.
i'll get the stepladder.
"i know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot."
don't order for me. i'm not hungry.
my hard drive crashed.
"yes, and you have to make a reservation."
i enjoy listening to all kinds of music.
i saw it eight times.
that's what i'm going to do.
does it pick up any digital channels?
i don't have any idea.
let me help you.
not a lot. what about you?
who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
and i have to take care of our children.
i don't know anyone who likes it.
can we call the police?
"that should be a nice trip. lots of fun, and lots of food."
me too.
"yes, i looked there, too."
he never wins your money?
no. that's incomplete.
why do they hurt?
natural food has more vitamins.
teaching is a great job.
"well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here."
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
i was unable to make it.
we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
and then you chase it.
i don't know. maybe it was from a shopping cart.
what does that have to do with it?
who invented flossing?
we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
it's not too bitter for you?
"no, it's earth day."
maybe he's just a liar.
where are the band-aids?
"yes, i do."
"oh, thank you. that's very nice of you."
thank you.
paper is flying everywhere.
who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.
why not?
has anyone told you about jessica's party coming up?
what time does the recycle truck come by?
i do it every once in a while.
i enjoyed talking to you too.
i went to macy's and picked it out.
was something wrong with the phone?
teaching is the best part of my whole day.
what happened?
i hate flossing more than brushing!
i'm throwing a party on friday.
i'll try.
no one believes that the crime rate is going down.
nothing really. how about you?
you get to put someone in power that you like.
i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
what happened?
that doesn't make it right.
"yes, i think he did."
how are you going to vote?
i think it will be.
"well, that's okay."
yelling doesn't do any good.
i pour lots of french dressing on top.
"so do i, but not if they're rich."
that's too bad. how much is a new one?
uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.
"this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen."
are you enjoying it there?
i had no idea.
i like living here.
i got out of my car.
it has beautiful houses.
bacon and eggs?
i said i have to go to the bathroom.
our team played hard and won.
yes. i called for a clean-up.
"when i have time, i sometimes draw and paint."
i bought the movie. would you like to come to my house and watch it?
"some men do, but not me."
"i'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too."
"well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help."
that's a great price.
do you know why?
i wonder if i should bring my gloves.
who's paying for that?
why did they ever let him out?
i think that's an excellent reason to like something.
there's no food in the woods.
and then we can turn right at the light.
have you heard something that you're not telling me?
okay. i'll feed him right now.
i'll bet the car continued on its way.
a puddle of water is very dangerous.
what should our flag look like?
you'd be blind for the rest of your life!
"so, you didn't become a doctor."
doesn't that get old?
talk to you then.
but there are a lot of police.
do they allow pets?
you got up real early.
are you serious?
i have to get off the phone now.
"whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face."
"i'll give you a speech like that, too."
"yeah, i loved that class."
i don't like to eat leftovers.
when did he die?
have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
i hope we'll see a home run.
"i love you, too."
that wasn't very nice of her.
but typing is causing you pain.
but i have rabbit ears.
"if you get sick, i'll return the favor."
i have no idea how much it will cost.
many people think their vote doesn't matter.
wow! that is nice. let's stay for two nights.
nothing really.
"yes, i dried everything in the dryer."
no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.
that's horrible. i'd be happy to give you the assignments from english class.
that's nice.
and then i made lunch.
i saw what you did.
really?
he swam right up to you.
which school do you attend?
how do they do that?
what was the reason for your call?
you think so?
all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
because they always do.
"maybe you should, just in case it gets colder."
our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.
"it is delicious, especially with butter."
"yes, everybody gets the public broadcasting system."
"thanks, i feel the same way."
but what can you do?
"i like all my classmates, too."
i was doing my homework.
it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
"yes, and i sealed the envelope."
that's the truth.
what kind of dog do you have?
the neighbors don't party on the weekends.
why did she leave you?
i really hope it doesn't get cold.
"no, i didn't."
that's a good price.
i have to go shopping today.
"yes, i felt like i was actually there."
how did you get it?
and they will yell back at you.
you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
i am really excited for you.
"okay, what do you want to sell?"
i appreciate that.
how do they do that?
"yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes."
"the sandwich was good, too."
"yes, just like fruit that is too ripe."
where's your money?
his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.
did you go to school today?
he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
they're in a different world.
i listen to various types of music.
but i don't have a tissue.
"of course not. if i do that, i'll lose my job."
i've just been working really hard.
i'll get her a nice card.
our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.
who are you voting for?
"that's right, it really would be."
i think we should really do something sometime.
no more homework.
it's okay. it's a really big campus.
"no, not recently."
did he understand what the problem is?
i forgot.
what happens when the fire alarm rings?
look! he just got out of the car and started running.
there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.
that should be loads of fun.
i'm fine. how about yourself?
thanks.
friends will lend you money when you're broke.
"no, we won't have money for gas or food."
now you're thinking.
especially on toast.
of course.
i hope they find them and put them in jail for life.
i will.
"no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october."
it took us all day.
because you need variety.
where were the cars?
are you crazy?
yes?
pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.
did you take pictures at the world war ii monument?
i know. every day the weather seems different.
do you take good care of it?
it's the law.
"some of it is okay, i guess."
yes. that way it will stay where i put it.
"yes. i think when you get old, you begin to smell."
i don't know. i think i'm average.
"do it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials."
i add some pepper and salt.
he'll give you a prescription for glasses.
"well whatever, i'm glad you came."
i've been trying to call you all day.
"criminals, of course."
i'll get the bait.
like what?
do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
that sounds great.
why do you say that?
i may know which girl you're talking about.
"no, i haven't."
so do i.
"yes, and it takes about five minutes each time."
about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.
"oh, yes. i wash it once a week."
i stayed home because i wasn't feeling well.
i'll put on my cap.
the government says we have nothing to worry about.
you never know what might happen on these freeways.
then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
he thinks i have too much stress.
"of course, the cheese with holes in it."
will you lose all your files?
"a lot, like the party i'm having on friday."
i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.
mine too.
that would be fun.
i'll make sure and make it to the next one.
now you're mine forever.
"me, too."
that's okay with me.
"no, but my feet don't hurt anymore."
"well, that should get you something."
that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
no one knows what happens after we die.
i wish i had never started.
i'm calling the waiter.
yes. a cow is man's best friend.
"oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter."
yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
"but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons."
"yes. after two u.s. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway."
"you should have, but have you seen any movies lately?"
he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
that's my perfume.
"well, i would never buy her cd."
i think only the family will be there.
what else?
i parked it right here.
"it has about 140,000 people."
the tape recorder is broken.
"if you lose your job, you can move in with me."
i need a notebook.
how rude.
do you think i'm getting fat?
except we can't afford it!
so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
then we'll just make a u-turn.
how many rich people do you know?
i'm having a party this friday.
"if it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?"
why doesn't it close?
she laughed! she didn't believe me.
look! he just got out of the car and started running.
everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
i hope so. i have to go to the bathroom.
these are some chucks.
"i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too."
"this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen."
i bought lots of oranges and apples.
why not?
"yes, he was smoking a cigarette."
our kids are completely safe.
good luck with that.
and eat too much.
"nothing, how about you?"
i got divorced two years ago.
"when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes."
i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
he wanted to take it home yesterday.
i'll make sure and come to your next party.
did you find a spot?
that woman is a very good singer.
i know that.
i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
they might think that i've got an ipod or laptop in there.
he helped make the yankees the best team ever.
"""deal or no deal"""
how far away is it?
"""mi"" stands for middle initial."
what's stopping you then?
his life sucked. he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
"give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you."
you mean he could drown.
maybe the banana was bad.
"let me look. no, it's not there."
is it beautiful?
i hate brushing my teeth.
"do it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials."
you have to change their diapers.
"well, when does the party start?"
look at this traffic.
you might be right.
do they allow pets?
are you sure? i never heard of such a thing.
like what?
that's terrible. can't people just have fun at a baseball game?
you don't want to do that.
i just cut myself again.
the dome doesn't close.
it was nice talking to you too.
what else do we get from cows?
i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
i had to blow my nose.
you must be lonely. i will share my friends with you.
that's horrible. i'd be happy to give you the assignments from english class.
we can kill two birds with one stone.
yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
how many are there?
"yeah, are you going to come?"
"oh, you actually do that?"
without the peanut butter!
i've been pretty busy myself.
"give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you."
what about her facial features?
tv news is so stupid.
no good movies come to mind.
my wife and i will be cremated.
i hate to fly.
i injured my back one time just by sneezing.
i don't really feel too well yet.
will it be good beach weather?
"but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!"
because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
i believe so.
i would if i had the money.
did you take some sort of art class or something?
so do i.
some actress was in court for driving without a license.
it's not even 10 o'clock.
"oh, look. i have four tens."
i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.
nothing that's interesting.
i would've thought that somebody would have told you.
the score was 101-98.
i saw you looking at that woman.
it's supposed to be unlucky.
did you shine your shoes?
"they always tell us ""what's next."""
that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.
that's a great price.
what makes him so bad?
why not?
"well, there is one good table."
i checked all my pockets.
it has wonderful restaurants.
she said that nothing is more important to me than money.
"i can smell you, too."
i didn't realize that.
but he dives to relax.
i don't think so.
i'm not going to eat any snails!
i have a date tomorrow night.
"my boss offered me a promotion, and i took it."
did she catch you using drugs?
it sure isn't.
who are you voting for?
children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
i have no idea. all of a sudden i heard your siren.
i'd have to say babe ruth.
i'll make sure and come to your next party.
especially on toast.
excuse me.
of course you do.
do you like it?
i can't get a single channel.
so do i.
was there much damage?
he didn't give you any medication?
i think he is from outer space.
i hope i don't come back as a fish.
what do you think it is?
the dome doesn't close.
"but now work is hard, too."
i went to the beach every day.
it's too dangerous for kids and pets.
who cares? let's get out of here.
how are you going to vote?
all day long we heard tvs or telephones.
"not a lot, what about you?"
what about that new game show?
i usually eat a simple salad.
"to the city, of course."
that was a mistake.
they might think i'm stupid.
it was nothing for him.
because i watch the other players.
so why did you get a ticket?
it sure is.
let's go for a ride.
we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
i have to walk the dog.
why haven't you answered the phone?
i wasn't picking my nose.
i first learned how to do it in high school.
what would you like to see?
how much is it?
what height is she?
"no, because it hurts my ears."
that's great.
are they comfortable?
it has great schools.
are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
my waist is bigger than it was.
men singers don't have to look good.
and then we can go to my home.
"well, he's got plenty of time now!"
where do you get that?
i missed you too.
really? why?
it's not comfortable.
to try something new and exciting.
"maybe i know, but how could you know?"
because you don't want to smell bad.
that's not a good start.
and i want to get a big cabin with a view.
where do you go to watch people?
i have to feed them.
"he said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it."
i think i might go and find me my own pair of chucks.
i wish i was really smart.
what's the matter?
i used all my savings on this one company.
thank you very much.
you're right.
they're probably getting something under the table.
don't worry about what people think.
oh. that's simple enough.
i'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
"okay, what kind of job do you want?"
this looks like a nice table.
"for example, a friend of mine licks his lips."
my ear is killing me.
that sounds like a nice date.
we should hang out some time.
all the radios will be on extra loud.
it isn't easy to see.
"okay, she's not fat. so what's the problem with her?"
they say they want change.
what if i don't like her?
they look so stupid taking a puff.
the stars look so much closer after it rains.
i am really excited for you.
it's common sense.
that's not nice.
what do you need to do?
thank you. so do you.
what do you mean?
"i've heard about it, but i'm still waiting for my invitation."
"no. he was nice, but there was no chemistry."
i can't remember jokes.
a little cigarette controls them.
"i will chop your toes off, one by one."
last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
i'd rather be cold than hot.
did he get rich from his poetry?
about what?
it's a paper cut.
that's why we need to save money.
i'm sure you have a talent. it's just hidden.
i was a painter.
but you know that california weather is really unpredictable.
"every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much."
because it has great teachers.
but the house is so nice.
are you even going to go?
what do you put in it?
"yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space."
they think it's cool.
doing what?
that trip must have cost a lot of money. 
"you think so, how come?"
what does it say?
tell me when you finish.
he's the only candidate that i trust.
what's your mailing address?
and you save $10.
i'll get our fishing rods.
it happens all the time.
what are you eating now?
what are they?
"oh, look. i have four tens."
then why aren't i having fun?
"well, nobody else does, so why should i?"
what's that?
i really can't stand going to parties.
no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators.
they got $1 each.
"yes, but they seem to have legs."
that's pretty simple.
i ate free cheese and meat every day.
i will rub gently but firmly.
there are so many things you have to do right.
why didn't you go to school yesterday?
but no one knows for sure.
you know what you did.
they're behind the outfield.
"you'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it."
"yes, but i don't know where the orange cones are."
he might say you have bone cancer.
"oh, you'll have somethingÂ—you'll have a lesson you'll never forget!"
i can't spend four hours on the road every day.
"you won't catch me, because i love you. i'm not a cheater."
hmm. i have only one best friend.
don't ask me.
i want to move to new york.
yikes! who can remember all that?
"how about ""let it be?"""
what will you do?
"yes, cheese is nice."
i know that.
they talk about food and the weather.
why don't you go to bed?
you're right. bad guys might rob you.
did you need something?
today is friday the thirteenth.
did he get off the hood?
i'm an open book. watch me all you want.
how do you know?
she's about five feet even.
i like the political cartoons.
"when you finish, all you do is start another job!"
thank you. i just got these shoes today.
and then you hit it again.
i went to see it the day it came out.
i'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
who would turn in a gun for $200?
is that right? i already got my invitation from her earlier.
"without gravity, the water would go up."
"i'm thinking, but i still have to go."
i'm looking in the newspaper for a job.
"that would be nice, thank you."
"but the title of measure 1 is ""better schools at no cost."""
"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave."
how about a movie?
that would make it easier for us to make plans.
i have things to do.
maybe he ran out of gas.
you get to put someone in power that you like.
it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!
a man i met in a coffee shop.
i did.
i think he is from outer space.
you don't have any elbow room or knee room.
a good gun costs $400 or more.
but i do all my writing with my right hand.
"no, he said he gently placed the boy on the street."
you're yawning.
that sounds like a great job.
he gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
"yes, i saw it on the tv news."
"no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school."
it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
did you do the laundry?
it didn't smell bad.
what's the matter with it?
what's the rush?
"seriously, i am so excited."
so you're not very good at math?
what do they say about us?
what do you listen to?
i haven't decided yet.
i got a promotion at my job.
"cigarettes, of course."
but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
do you really love me?
"you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold."
no. that will cost too much money.
we'll go to a french restaurant.
yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.
the worst in the whole world.
the car isn't here.
"number three, it doesn't run 24 hours."
i thought i would wait until october.
