"so, you didn't become a doctor."
me too.

it's six years old.
"i enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes."
life is hard.

do they talk about us?
"well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents."
"it sure is, but i'm going to call hp first, just to make sure."
what was the reason for your call?
he's never going to make everyone happy.
i love salads.
sure.
what happened?
our school did. they played really well.
"that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not living people."
don't be ridiculous.
they added phony charges to our bill.
"hey, did you hear about jessica's party this weekend?"
that's what i'm going to do.
i got it from macy's.
there's nothing i can think of.
"also, there aren't enough police."
it's the funniest movie that i've ever seen.
look how many cars are waiting in line.
of course they are. they're starving to death.
your shoes look really nice. how much did you get them for?
that's a good price.
but it's real easy to slip on.
you have got to be talented.
"what's ""variety?"
a couple of months ago.
it's worse than that.
what should our flag look like?

natural food has more vitamins.
"well, it gives me money, but it's my own money."
"first, i have to find the button."
what do you mean?
then you can wipe your seat and window.
"yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on ebay."
it puts me to sleep.
maybe it's the wrong tree.
you're right. the buses are never on time.
"it's a little bitter, but it's okay."
no way! i don't want to fall to my death.
"i want this trip to be perfect, i hope it stays warm."
"oh, why is that?"
can we afford it?
"every so often, i do."
i hate to fly.
my parents are divorced.
"yes, you chased me and then you caught me."
what do they talk about?
that's terrible! when did it happen?
"no, it isn't. a flat costs you time and money."
i think he wanted to cool off.
i hope so. i have to go to the bathroom.
look in the fridge.
a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs?
"i really wanted you to come, but i understand."
how do you like it so far?
why?
how were you sick?
i have a stomachache.
i have things to do.
"oh, thank you. that's very nice of you."
winter is great. i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
"i don't know, but was there a certain movie you wanted to see?"
that's pretty old.

do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
i hate flying.
here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.
why weren't you at school yesterday?
my husband died.
you must be kidding.
who cares? everyone is strange.
have you seen a doctor?
i will as soon as i finish this article.
thank you very much.
she's about five feet even.
i've really been working a lot lately.
only 11 percent?
i'm a babysitter.
so what? did he dial 911?
because of all the earthquakes and fires.
you're jammed in with people all around you.
"no, it's earth day."
and he poured water into our glasses.
that trip must have cost a lot of money. 
about finding a job for me.
"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too."
let's go for a ride.
one hundred!
i don't think so.
what was wrong with you?
"anyway, i have to fix the hole."
where are the seats?
you can borrow mine.
can we call the police?
i'm going to pcc.
all the news in only 50 pages.
"turn the radio down, please."
i did too.
they should stay in the woods where they belong.
look at all these kittens!
"half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing."
we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
i stood on the great wall and looked all around.
nothing.
yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
the ocean is so big.
would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?
"$1,000."
"yes, it is. but it still looks good."
"yes, but i talk to him almost every day."
i can't remember jokes.
did you dry everything in the dryer?
what are you talking about?
that's a good question.
no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators.
but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
"if it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?"
i think it will only take you a year or two.
that doesn't matter. i don't want to sit around.
i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
how long have you known how to do that?
his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
it was on sale.
"yes, i did."
i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.
"yes, it's a $140 ticket."
i didn't have a tissue.
eight.
i got a ticket downtown for $140.
have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
of course. i have lots of best friends.
so how do you think positive?
those shopping carts are dangerous.
it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
"oh, no. that's bad news."
"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection."
then maybe it's in your genes.
i like to hit the ball.
is that right?
i feel like chinese.
i guess so.
i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
what's on tv?
i'll start dinner at 6:00.
it's more like news for kids.
what happened to the other student?
i really like those. how much did they cost?
really? who with?
i don't like riding the bus.
i'm bored.
wow! that's terrible.
female singers are supposed to be pretty.
you might be right.
it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.
once in a while is once too many.
they call him father dollar bill.
so did i.
none that i can think of.
i'm serious. you deserved this promotion.
did he crash?
"oh no, another pimple on my face."
then why aren't i having fun?
i'm looking in the newspaper for a job.
maybe i left the burner on.
i didn't realize that.
now you're thinking.
"mom, i want a puppy."
i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
"i love you, too."
tell me how she looks.
they need 300 new workers.
are you feeling any better?
"yes, old people don't smell like fruit."
is there somewhere special you wanted to go?
"i don't have a girlfriend, either."
what did you do?
"oh, no. we can walk right in."
i've called you a hundred times today.
tell me when you finish.
but most of those hurricanes are harmless.
why is that?
then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.
i know. i really want to go to the beach.
don't pick your nose.
when exactly does the party start?
i guess people just don't care.
is that what you really think?
"so, will you be at school tomorrow?"
the city is buying guns.
that should be loads of fun.
how did you get it?
the book is open.
"if you lose your job, you can move in with me."
he spoke to them and made them feel better.
and a puppy eats food. food costs money.
but the smell is different.
"i had a car problem, so i went online."
i'd better see you there.
you're right. i think it's going to rain later.
"in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining."
nothing much.
same here.
what is it that you need to do? 
you're forgetting about the bathroom.
"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard."
those are nice. what are they?
where do you get that?
"it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity."
he didn't give you any medication?
my wife and i will be cremated.
i'll say.
we get a free breakfast.
"okay, i'll talk to you later then."
"this year he gave away $15,000."
that's not right!
"well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain."
why would he do that?
"yes, just like fruit that is too ripe."
why don't you go to bed?
that's a good deal.
i listen day and night.
where are you going?
i'll get her a nice card.
do you have a digital tv?
are you even going to go?
i sure hope not.
i think there are more fish.
of course it did. why stop after you've run over two people?
"no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school."
i injured my back one time just by sneezing.
"okay, i'll get a bucket."
"i'm a man, and men don't carry purses!"
"okay, i give up."
he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
maybe it's something in your diet.
what happened before?
the one that stole a small plane?
"like what, for instance?"
i haven't decided yet.
it should be warmer in a few minutes.
because we need to buy a house.
did you like it?
but his latest fire killed someone.
because you don't want to smell bad.
why don't you wash it?
what's the weather going to be like this weekend?
it's so nice to have a heated apartment.
"that's nice, but tell me what she looks like."
smokers think they are so cool.
i wish my eyes were blue.
i want to go on a cruise ship.
"i can smell you, too."
i want to get a puppy for my son.
i got laid off.
i will have a radio in every room of my house.
did they explain how it's possible?
i think that she is very pretty.
you should loosen your belt.
"i couldn't help laughing, either. "
"yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best."
i attended school today. did you?
i buy it at the dollar store.
that is a beautiful house.
but that's what most people do.
but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?
"i'm serious, have you?"
"the usual, cereal with milk and a banana."
what do you mean?
it's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
you know what that means.
nothing really. how about you?
how can it be fun?
they could even crack their head open.
"i have to say, my favorite movie is superbad."
i thought you heard.
i was told about it already. i'm just waiting for my invitation.
we don't even know what kind most of them are.
your chances are very small.
i'd rather not.
it was new in 2003.
i could pick only one or the other?
i want it to cool down some.
that means month/day/year. use numbers.
what do you want me to do?
thank you. i just got these shoes today.
i'd have to say babe ruth.
no. it costs too much money.
are you married?
"i'm sorry, but i have to go."
did you really?
when's that?
thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever.
i think that it's going to rain.
you should go to bed.
we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
i think only the family will be there.
i'm not interested in her.
kids are crying or climbing over you.
have you gone to school today?
"yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers."
yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.
you're very lucky.
what are you going to do with an english major?
that sounds wonderful.
i like to run around the bases.
i think i lost it today. i used it yesterday.
it wasn't that loud.
"yes, i do."
i love your outfit right now.
that's why we need to save money.
it's not my fault. you didn't wake me up.
artists see things differently.
but we need to turn left.
i can't believe that they would lie to us.
"yeah, i went to school today. were you there?"
"no, because it hurts my ears."
what happened?
thanks for coming to see me today.
what are you going to do with them?
i didn't say that.
i'm a good card player.
the bread is in the cabinet.
put on a coat and tie.
have you heard about jessica's party on saturday?
it's supposed to start at about eight.
how much was that?
what's going on?
did you hear the news?
i'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
did you hear the good news?
that sounds like a dream job.
"no, i hate vegetables."
once every two months.
"it hurts, too."
you should unplug the phone.
"maybe i know, but how could you know?"
so why are we selling our house?
did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.?
but a nice restaurant costs money.
he's rude and he yells a lot.
yes. all my life.
"yes, it was."
okay. what will you teach me?
we can leave if we put an orange cone here.
ready for the big switch.
you need a bath every day.
because i'll never find one for such a low price.
at 8:00 p.m.
you never know what might happen on these freeways.
i'll bet they were drinking.
"hi, how are you doing?"
are you going to wash it yourself?
"no, i don't like nose drops."
what about the unfriendly dogs?
they still make movies like that.
i'm not being nosey. i'm just asking.
you have no idea how happy i am for you.
that sounds like fun. where do you want to go?
"that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store."
i know. i had to chase you for a while.
buy a new one.
i'm sorry. i'm already doing something this friday.
was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
what do you mean?
but i need something that's reliable.
she's kind of short.
these are chucks.
there's a real nice park nearby.
this time they have charged him with murder.
the husband said he tried to help the boy.
i have a little poodle.
florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.
"it was long, too."
why not?
i'm not quite sure yet.
i went to the market yesterday.
that's okay.
"yes, i've passed all my tests."
why did you get divorced?
it's the slowest hamburger in town.
nothing that's interesting.
i forgot.
this is a great neighborhood.
i have to go back upstairs.
spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.
"oh my god, that's great!"
of course you do.
i was unable to make it.
how do you know?
"yes, i like that one, too."
thank you.
"i would really appreciate that, thanks."
"no, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant."
so what was the score?
"we get a lot of things from cows, don't we?"
i'm in love with that girl.
what's your email address?
where do you want to go?
that sounds like a good spot.
i'll hold you to that.
i'll bet the car continued on its way.
like what?
what is your major?
no human can do that.
officials said that it's possible.
maybe she's different.
the streets are clean and quiet.
i appreciate that.
he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
i don't want to see a movie by myself.
it's probably around somewhere.
i had a long day.
i don't want to go to hell.
"i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges."
have you looked in the mirror?
i have no insurance.
that's a lot of money.
did you get free food?
the digital signal is very clear.
i was not looking at her.
but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
have you decided how you are going to vote?
i think so. it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.
i can smell you.
i told her that school is fun.
"no, it's too close to the salad bar."
uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.
it hurt her feelings.
"well, that's okay."
he will end the war.
"yes. i think when you get old, you begin to smell."
thank you.
did you make it to school today?
what's so good about it?
we won't have any money for other things?
i like to watch people.
they were about forty dollars.
that's what everyone says.
how did we end up in that terrible hotel?
it's so much trouble.
because it has great teachers.
a good gun costs $400 or more.
our kids are completely safe.
get better.
it's too dangerous for kids and pets.
so what did he tell you to do?
me too.
how did he do it?
not yet. it's been a week.
are you serious?
that's because they cook it while you wait.
"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court."
i first learned how to do it in high school.
some people would just pick it up.
it's no problem. i was really missing you anyway.
i go to pcc.
i was there when i was a kid.
"tell me about it, dad."
i was crossing the street.
they have to see it happen.
maybe four or five pounds?
and he's really smart.
you must be joking.
people think you might be sick.
"yes, he was smoking a cigarette."
i can't read my book.
which one?
he stayed on the thirteenth floor.
did you yell at them?
i really want to go to the beach this weekend.
it doesn't look very nice outside today.
you're not going to be buried?
that's the way cats are.
prove it.
i don't know. i just woke up.
everything's been good with you?
why not?
i've got to go.
the husband said a fire department was nearby.
it's always good to have friends.
did you look in the desk drawer?
why don't you look outside?
let's take a walk.
"well, i guess that's it."
i saw what you did.
that was a nice funeral.
what's the matter?
and there was no violence.
i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
"yes, and i hope that it does."
don't order for me. i'm not hungry.
she laughed! she didn't believe me.
i think i'm going to explode.
there sure are — at least a million.
that was nice of you.
i like it so far. my classes are pretty good right now.
i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
what are you reading?
what did you say to her?
"well, why don't you?"
"i don't know, maybe one hundred."
"hey, what's up?"
he hates democrats and republicans.
that's exactly how i felt.
not yet.
"just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world."
is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?
who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.
only a threat?
it comes from cows.
"but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!"
i didn't love you at first.
it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
my mother was hurt and angry.
how far away is that?
"okay, let's sit down."
beer is a powerful drug.
did you want to go?
she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
and grow a beard?
"she raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?"
i've been coming here for years.
i'm really happy that you came to visit me.
what height is she?
do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
did you go to school today?
i wasn't done talking to you.
where does he travel to?
how many tires were cut?
"the sandwich was good, too."
i watered all the plants.
what do you mean?
"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave."
is this table okay?
i see that you're pretty talented.
so are mine.
i think golfers have a mental problem.
what are you doing?
"when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes."
i sure do.
she's probably about five feet.
because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
can't we hire more police?
they both said i have to live with it.
"yes, rained out."
"yeah, you should have. it was really exciting."
what's a little blood?
i live in pasadena.
can you make it?
"no, i'm serious."
did you ever take an iq test?
check out the silverware.
and he yelled back at me.
we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
you're right. a car is faster.
i got out of my car.
why haven't you answered the phone?
i'm a handyman.
i'll make sure and come to your next party.
i have the dvd.
it's getting later every minute.
i'll definitely try to make it the next time.
"wow, how exciting."
maybe he's just a liar.
why?
"me, neither."
"yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals."
"that was a great trip to washington, d.c."
"no, i'm not. it's march. time is running out. seats are selling out right now."
i really love how rain clears the air.
what a great song.
"yes, it's beautiful."
my stomach was upset.
"lately, i've been quite busy."
"yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu."
"and it's deep, too."
then i have a job for you in my kitchen.
"yes, that will occur next month."
that's not a good start.
what do you like about it?
"yes, i did."
yes. you really deserved this.
do you want to go fishing?
i would if i had the money.
"i know, it does sound pretty awesome."
"yes, and i sealed the envelope."
to the grand canyon?
there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.
who's paying for that?
what are you talking about?
it didn't smell bad.
you don't want to do that.
i just really don't want to go.
"first of all, he was half an hour late."
"if they are all outside, then what?"
she's really pretty.
"no, i haven't."
your white shirt is ruined.
"yes, i took them off the pillows and washed them."
"yes, you have to take care of your wife."
they're very comfortable.
i like this hotel.
i think some fish have blue eyes.
"oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?"
i gave a subscription to my parents.
"it was, until one day my manager caught me."
i'm in a hurry.
the invitation says it starts at 8:00 p.m.
that's for sure.
that's disgusting.
which would you prefer?
i think there's one on the dining room table.
i'll go up front and talk to the manager.
"yes, but i don't know where the orange cones are."
eleven cars.
i hate going to parties.
i don't like riding the bus.
a great burger and great service.
i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.
why not?
i have a honda.
"oh, really? that's nice."
our tv remote is filthy.
i can't believe how hot it is.
what's going on with you?
is it his money?
did you have a date friday night?
i'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
because you can see the stars perfectly.
no. they said there are some things you can't explain.
"exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. it's too hot."
they're in the kitchen drawer.
i toss and turn all night.
it might as well be me.
what did they say?
what did you do?
"so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything."
but they can just knock on the door.
we watch people walk by with their dogs.
your day was just like mine.
they sure do.
no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.
"still, it's safer than florida."
yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.
"""mi"" stands for middle initial."
"what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes."
"oh, yes, i took him there yesterday. he showed me one that he really liked."
"yes, he went through the red light."
that's a good idea.
i took the dog for a walk.
about 90 of us world war ii veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m.
"me, too. school was fun."
"i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you."
i'm throwing a party on friday.
you put all your eggs into one basket.
"okay, what kind of job do you want?"
don't they clean the bus every night?
but what can you do?
i knew you didn't love me.
"i had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them."
a man i met in a coffee shop.
this steak has too much fat.
swiss.
"yes, he did. his cat died, too."
i need pencils.
yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
that's what you think.
we went to a nice restaurant.
remember to put air in your tires.
but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.
i absolutely love what you're wearing today.
three pounds just this month.
how did you get it?
they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
"""deal or no deal"""
no one believes that the crime rate is going down.
"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes."
"it is delicious, especially with butter."
this is my favorite show.
have you done your homework?
"no, they don't. one is black and one is dark blue."
i'm trying to stretch my dollars.
i think they do.
me too.
can we go to the baseball game?
what are you standing on?
high school.
i had to blow my nose.
i washed the sheets and towels.
let me help you.
"if the company goes out of business, i'll have nothing."
what would you do if you lost your job?
why are they doing this?
i bought it on a hunch.
the price of stamps goes up and up.
i don't like that man.
how much is that?
did you tell her about school?
i don't like practice.
so it won't get sick. just like you get shots.
that's what i thought.
"they are clean, too."
i used to work in a deli.
a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going to be?
the cops finally found the husband.
what are you talking about?
why didn't you go to school yesterday?
what does that have to do with it?
"yes, i saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters."
i like living here.
room service brought us a cold dinner.
any rain right now would be pointless.
today is friday the thirteenth.
a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.
"some of it is okay, i guess."
"yes, dad, it was."
and then we can go to my home.
"brush, brush. spit, spit."
he was asking for it.
poodles bark a lot.
"well, i can always pull over."
he's a chain smoker.
the streets and sidewalks are clean.
what were you doing?
but a cop might stop you.
"to the city, of course."
fine. what's going on with you?
they need a left-turn arrow.
the tape recorder is broken.
how tall would you say that she is?
i don't know.
now they're adding old tv shows to the old movies.
we also get leather.
that won't make you rich. nobody will talk to you.
singers are supposed to sound good.
i'll be glad when winter comes.
really?
we must be here for some reason.
i've been pretty busy myself.
nothing that would pass as news.
i think we are!
it was nice talking to you too.
that takes some time.
i voted for obama.
i'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during christmas.
you're supposed to stay home all day.
i took something earlier.
"hmm, that's not bad."
"yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year."
my favorite movie is superbad.
"yeah, i think i'll go."
it's the truth. i am really happy.
"let me look. no, it's not there."
how do you know that?
pimples suck.
what did you say? i think i've gone deaf.
it sounds like it will be.
people are friendly.
he apologized to the fans.
and carry it into the house.
you eat too much chocolate.
no. movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
"i know, you should really go and see her and the baby."
just wait until you're 50 years old.
that's okay with me.
that was a long time ago.
"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly."
i enjoy listening to both rock and r&b.
"sure, what did you want to do?"
"he's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out."
"yes, and you have to make a reservation."
doesn't that get old?
how are you doing today?
i need a notebook.
that was a huge fire in santa barbara.
but i'm listening to it.
that was mean to say.
no good movies come to mind.
they are the best musical group ever.
that's good to hear.
my grandma's apartment smells funny.
"yes, i think so too."
you know how to draw and paint?
i don't have enough will power.
i think i'll make a sandwich.
did someone steal it?
doctors are too expensive.
"every time we eat out, it's an adventure."
"you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?"
tell me what you've been up to.
so how do you plan to become rich?
or artists.
you must be lonely. i will share my friends with you.
another family?
"yes, i guess most of us are stuck in a routine."
did you find a solution?
one that won't grow up too big.
but the swine flu just killed 20 people in mexico.
it passes inspection.
i don't understand.
that is a lot of friends. do you have a best friend?
let's stop for a while. i need a break and some water.
i'm looking. there's nothing to eat.
why? i'm watching the original.
yes. i have to breathe through my mouth.
yikes! what was that noise?
what would you like to see?
here he comes now.
why did she do that?
"yes, if they do it quickly."
"i apologize, but i'm getting off the phone now."
"thank you for inviting me, but i think i'll pass."
then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
i was thinking of driving to arizona.
the tires on the cars.
"yes. it isn't there, either."
i thought you had a job.
me too.
they were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.
what store did you get it from?
that's only a penny a minute!
i've actually been busy lately.
what have you been doing?
i'm going to be a teacher.
that's a good reason to like something.
stop thinking about what the point is.
the mayor says the crime rate is going down.
i had to bring work home with me.
see an eye doctor.
what are you going to be doing?
what were you doing?
what do you mean?
"well, they do put their party before their country."
what happened?
and there are only six units in the whole building.
that's pretty simple.
"one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce."
she has pretty light brown eyes.
what good does it do?
i was doing my homework.
okay. i'll tell you how the show ends.
of course i will.
when did you lose it?
i didn't think you saw that movie.
what happened?
no.
"oh, really? who won?"
that's a good deal.
that hotel was terrible.
what did you say?
i got laid off because there was no work.
can i borrow $5?
i wouldn't do that.
it sure is.
so are we going to buy it?
"no, i didn't feel like it."
would you have dinner with me?
"if you get sick, i'll return the favor."
"no, i couldn't make it."
a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
thanks. i found these new shoes earlier at the store.
or we can go to the lake.
let's turn on the heat.
probably not.
i don't know.
what about the other homeless people?
will you lose all your files?
i would if i had the money.
those books will slip and you'll fall.
that's true. where did that money go?
what did you do?
it was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
"no, he won't. some cars are doing 85."
i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.
that's a good idea.
so why can't i have pizza for dinner?
so are cigarettes.
hopefully it will.
i'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
"no, thanks. i already took some medicine."
"i don't know. whenever the weather comes on, i switch channels."
did you save any money on the sale?
she said she didn't love me anymore.
just ask her out to dinner.
don't use water on it!
then it will look like new
i got a promotion at work earlier this week.
i'm going to the bank.
did he set a new record?
the home run hitter on drugs?
how many rich people do you know?
"so do i, like ""she loves you."""
do you know which one he would like?
"i don't think so. after i finish, i'll have enough money to go to college."
"yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven."
paper cuts can hurt a lot.
"next time you go to the market, let me go with you."
it shouldn't take him long to fix it.
i think i know who you're talking about.
"you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold."
but maybe prices will be cheaper in october.
read the phone number to me.
what do you put in it?
but you can't win if you don't play.
but the show will be over.
you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
he landed on the hood of the car.
everyone likes him.
give me a hug.
how much money do you have?
do you ever pray for money?
the next four years will be good years.
he might want to cut you open.
don't rub the numbers off the remote.
i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
i read a lot.
how much did you buy?
"no, it doesn't. puppies are free."
have you heard the news?
a good battery would have saved his life.
and they're clean.
you would do the same for me.
and watch your dvd.
"you know, that woman with the big boobs."
remind me to never visit you.
what was your problem?
it's supposed to be unlucky.
then why can't i quit?
they say that we are funny-looking.
or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
it's more than just a date.
what kind of car do you have?
it's close to the freeways.
i thought school was hard.
a recent fire destroyed 85 homes.
"if not, your nose will wake you up."
why haven't you tried to come see me then?
i haven't heard anything about it.
all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
are you reading this paper?
the sky is gray.
are you sure?
i had to. i was missing you a lot.
that must be nice.
they bark at everything.
where do you want to go?
have you decided whether or not you would like to go?
it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
a luxury car.
"how about ""let it be?"""
"oh, yes, i really like it."
and it's not too small.
i believe so.
can't he just go online?
the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
it's the best job i've ever had.
tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
"well, it's your life."
doesn't crime cost more than police?
that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
i'm not sure.
is that it?
i certainly hope not!
her mom is a great cook.
what's to check?
"oh, no. help yourself."
i didn't know that.
people are always getting up to use the bathroom.
did you see that puddle of water on the floor?
it was a great game.
so are they going to hold another election?
i don't know. i think it's old age.
"well, he can enjoy it while it lasts."
that one. the one that's all black.
teaching is the best part of my whole day.
what's wrong with it?
what do you have to do?
you're right.
i can't believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.
how easy is that?
have you taken anything for your cold?
are you going to travel alone?
about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.
it's not even 10 o'clock.
look at the car chase on tv!
"well, i guess you have to live with it."
"yeah, so are you planning on going?"
"a speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl."
did you see the waiter's hands?
wasn't there anything about octo-mom?
that's correct.
but i love coffee.
but i'm worried about tiger.
i want to move to new york.
there are so many great players.
you're joking.
she said that nothing is more important to me than money.
you have a lot of plants.
how can i prove it?
yes. i called for a clean-up.
it's got a big yard.
i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
"who knows? you live, and then you die."
are you really?
it smells so bad.
did you see the woman with the new face?
"mom, i'm hungry."
i type too much.
"yes, but only the cheap tickets."
describe her to me.
are there going to be layoffs at this place?
open the book.
it's really nice.
i had a busy morning.
it was love at first sight?
they might think that i've got an ipod or laptop in there.
did you put a stamp on the envelope?
he's a famous artist.
can we get tickets?
i don't like it.
what did you do?
"well, you can't have everything."
what kind of soup was that?
last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
what are you going to do?
"yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers."
he will be a great president.
"it's not too much, only about $85."
not much.
i've enjoyed conversing with you.
"i like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."
what do you mean?
"yes, it was love at first sight."
check your tires or you'll get a flat.
you mean he could drown.
are you serious?
what do you listen to?
every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
"i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?"
"no, a real breakfast."
"well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets."
"seriously, it looks really nice on you. where did you buy it from?"
what do you mean?
the beatles are the best.
we have to practice every day.
what are they?
what happened?
maybe i will be the first!
have you tried earplugs?
do you need a calculator?
i made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.
do you believe everything you hear?
"oh, yes. i wash it once a week."
you can watch tv after you do your homework.
"no, i haven't. why?"
you speak two languages.
look! he just got out of the car and started running.
that's six times a year!
let's go to the beach.
i did.
sometimes i wish i was back in school.
it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!
"and 4,000 people showed up."
bears are invading our neighborhoods.
and it's just as easy to prepare.
are you going to be buried next to each other?
and you get to play with a lot of dogs.
what's the point?
i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.
so how do you make long distance calls?
"what does ""mm/dd/yy"" mean?"
"yes, i do."
people talk about current events.
i'm having a party next saturday.
i enjoy rock and r&b.
i'll make an appointment tomorrow.
where do you get these crazy ideas?
never park your car under a tree.
excuse me.
i'm going to take five wipes.
thank you. so do you.
that's a lot of work.
you don't need a good nose for that — cigarettes stink.
how come?
this sunday?
she did? why didn't anyone tell me?
you are coming?
"no, thank you, i'll just wait."
you think they won't fit?
"her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down."
maybe we should honk the horn next time.
that isn't a good deal?
i don't know. the tag is missing.
are you sure?
i've got a date for you.
then why does everyone lock their doors?
what kind?
i have lots of friends.
what's up?
what do you think people joke about the most?
what happened?
of course. but i don't have cable.
they forget where they came from.
it was tomato soup.
"if you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day."
it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
so? that's a ticket?
someone should set him on fire.
coffee and a roll?
"i will chop your toes off, one by one."
your orange isn't orange?
get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
"well, i would never buy her cd."
"good afternoon, officer."
they're all the same.
"well, hold on a little longer."
"without gravity, the water would go up."
has anyone told you about jessica's party coming up?
i enjoyed talking to you.
of course. it's all over the news.
"no, i didn't go, i've been sick."
i have no idea.
but i don't have a tissue.
i'm throwing a party on friday.
really? why is it?
i can't believe how long this line is.
then why are you watching tv?
"oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean."
"yes, but i can't keep them."
i don't feel like going.
"we will be house rich, but cash poor."
a third guy punched one of the two guys.
"you're probably right, do you intend on going to the party?"
of course. he stops the fastest cars.
please?
"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet."
"of course not. if i do that, i'll lose my job."
really?
i hate shots.
they're behind the outfield.
no one makes any money at it.
"oh, really? maybe you should have called 911."
i don't get art.
voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.
i always cry at the end.
did she get a nice job?
it works only in canada.
i'll use a damp cloth.
"thank you very much, that's kind of you."
i missed you too.
i have to go to the bathroom.
it starts at 8 o'clock.
do you pray to god?
do you think you can come?
like what?
"yes, and he didn't tell the buyer."
i don't know.
forget it. go straight.
"well, my english isn't perfect."
did you see that car?
will you be able to make it?
is there a reason why?
two students from usc.
"if i catch you, you'll be sorry."
of course you can.
so go then.
"yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car."
but i do all my writing with my right hand.
and lots of thieves.
how soon can we begin?
"yes, it is."
"well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here."
"would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?"
because you need variety.
of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house.
bluedog123. are you sure that's all?
have you told her?
i've been missing you like crazy.
let's go jogging.
"i know, you're absolutely right."
"first you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers."
different things — not the same thing all the time.
do you like it?
like fruit that is too ripe?
it was really nice talking to you also.
we'll go to a french restaurant.
okay. teach me how to play.
what else do we get from cows?
i hope i win the lotto.
"if more people donate money, pbs could offer new shows."
because i want to make a lot of money.

what time does your plane leave?
are you going to go anywhere?
friends will lend you money when you're broke.
how are you going to do that?
i sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
you like to see it disappear.
"when i have time, i sometimes draw and paint."
i will keep knocking on doors.
a mad dog bit most of her face off.
maybe you can come next time.
i called hp about my computer.
why would i do that?
she asked you about your pineapples?

"yes, we do."

no problem. i'll give him food off my plate.
because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
"no, the police don't care."
a bull chased a man in a supermarket.
"yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember."
i'm attending pcc right now.
what's stopping you then?
mostly talk radio.
did you ever see anything that picasso painted?
i see that former president bush is at a conference.
the wind blows those trucks over.
then we went to a jazz club.
what does it mean?
"no, i was crossing the street."
i had no idea.

i have only a few friends.
eat the fruit. it's good for you.
what's the matter?
i liked it.
"bluedog123 is just the street. you have to give me the city, state, and zip code."

i don't want to go alone.
you mean i will smell the food cooking?
i'll keep my receipt and my gun.
i filled up my freezer with ice cream.
you might even dream about dinner.
why didn't you take a nap when you got home?
what happened to your plans?
"and the rooms are clean, too."
you should take a break.
hmm. i have only one best friend.
it will cost you only $20 plus parts.
ha! you can't win if you do play.
"well, i think you look nice today too."
that was an odd change of subject.
paper is flying everywhere.
i thought you had an elephant in your house.
there are other things i need to take care of.
it's not too bitter for you?
i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.
why do you say that?
hold your breath till we get there.
yes?
but there are a lot of police.
why did your parents get divorced?
it would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.
i'm sorry for you.
my waist is bigger than it was.
i enjoy drawing and painting.
i can't get a single channel.

"but now work is hard, too."
i hate shaving.
are you going to college?
we're stuck with him for four more years.
are you looking for another job?
i agree. work is just as hard as school.
why is that?
"so we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?"
did you need something?
what did they do in the old days?
"but, mom!"
i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
"oh, you actually do that?"
that's a good idea.
how much is it?
and then you chase it.
that's a good question. maybe it's not old age.
i wish i could afford first class seats.
of course.
you can travel all over the world.
nobody has told me anything about your party.
"well, there is one good table."
"only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas."
don't we have about five sharpeners?
i can add two and two.
it's not even noon yet.
it's okay.
so do i.
your nose is stopped up?
i mixed them together.
did you take it to a computer shop?
rained out?
did he get off the hood?
i got them for forty.
i don't think so.
"oh, yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital."
i buried him with his cell phone.
is that a tv show?
"oh, so you took an art class?"
it's the automatic teller machine.
how much have you gained?
thanks.
"yes, that's right. it does get boring."
someone had to chop the wood.
"yes, just in english alone."
how about if i take shorter showers?
"what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?"
"well, you can't blame a man for asking."
there's no sugar or cream in it.
"yes, it is."
"yes, it's covered with crud."
he went to las vegas. he lost it all gambling.
"before you go to that interview, check yourself."
but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.
they were in the student parking lot.
i wish i could move here.
i think i know the difference between picking and scratching.
you haven't told me anything yet.
i would love to catch a movie this weekend.
"it blows trees over, too."
but it won't stop other players from using drugs.
i wish i was free that night. i'm kind of mad that i didn't go.
"okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner."
"no, today people like lots of action."
the walls were so thin.
they're all so cute.
did the cat bite you?
"nothing, except my favorite color is blue."
that's what made it so great.
i have to feed them.
put your seatbelt on.
so maybe we better leave at 8:15?
maybe you should record it.
what do you need to do?
that tasted so good.
that will cost him some money.
"no, i don't. do you?"
is it going to be perfect beach weather?
"yes, a lot of flags have stripes."
how far away is it?
we need to save enough for a down payment.
we had a problem at school.
"clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet."
why not?
what college do you go to?
i really missed you a lot.
rude people are everywhere.
but that's what pockets are for.
that sounds like a nice date.
i'm having a party this friday.
"what does ""mi"" mean?"
what does she look like?
it's only 10 minutes from here.
it gets worse every year.
that's your favorite thing to do?
what do you mean?
i couldn't find any stamps.
do you know any good jokes?
"i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one of mine."
"my dad went to washington, d.c."
i'm stuffed.
"well, you'd better get her something."
how much do we need to save?
"i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary."
i don't understand.
i can't stand cigarette smoke.
"yes, but she looks like a man."
"i'm sorry, i can't."
of course.
"well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help."
that didn't take long.
you're talking to her.
people will tell you if they have a good hand.
it's not orange!
of course! he's world famous.
his nails were black!
it's in california.
maybe he ran out of gas.
what do you want the waiter to do?
"she got an ""everything"" job!"
i'm doing great. what about you?
that's a great price.
how about a movie?
that's for sure.
why do we need to save money?
where did you park it?
was something wrong with the phone?
i have to clean the house.
i enjoy listening to all kinds of music.
you're funny.
i'm going to clean it.
our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.
i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.
i don't know. maybe i'm not rich enough.
"he said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it."
"that's not what i meant by ""do something."""
i can't afford it.
don't let water get into any of the cracks.
why did they ever let him out?
i appreciate that.
don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
"i'm not sure, but i don't think she's given out that many."
what did you like?
people will think i'm strange.
a gardening show follows a knitting show.
a family with only one baby.
think about something else. think about a hamburger.
did you always know how to draw and paint?
"yeah, i loved that class."
you don't need to worry about that.
you had an art class?
and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
you're right. buses don't run late at night.
i got laid off last week.
i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.
do you change the oil?
i checked all my pockets.
"i think i know, because this happened before."
who in the world is ralph nader?
are you having problems with it?
i saw it twelve times.
thank you.
i want you to clean the bathroom.
you'd be blind for the rest of your life!
don't you think it's nice out?
what do you mean?
why is that?
i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.
i just cut myself again.
"never better, thanks."
it goes on and on forever.
"well, if i have a big test at school."
there must be something on tv!
"the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it."
what have you been doing?
"yes, i saw it on the tv news."
do you know what movie you're going to watch?
"let me see. yes, you're right. your orange is pink."
"oh, no, you don't."
maybe we're here to have fun.
he might say i'm okay.
"yes, about $7 million."
"no, we won't have money for gas or food."
i honestly didn't know.
what school do you go to?
what was the score at the end of the game?
can't they eat grass?
it was hot and sunny every day.
we'll be here forever.
he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
this wind is dangerous for drivers.
i can't do that.
"well, he's made a few changes."
"no, it's too close to the kitchen door."
"they always make ""what's next"" sound exciting, but it never is."
are you going to start a family?
i'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow.
only if my candidate wins.
"seriously, i am so excited."
i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
i found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
another good deal.
do you like it there?
what's up?
that's true. it is a very funny movie.
we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
i just insert my debit card into the machine.
"no problem, you're welcome."
look! he just hit that car.
i really wish the weather would just stay the same.
"""Â…and you know you should be glad!"""
"my bad, i had chores to do."
will it be good beach weather?
you think i should quit playing.
what do you mean?
the government says we have nothing to worry about.
it's bluedog123.
me too.
i don't know how that store makes money.
i don't know which one i like the best.
"yes, i did."
that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
my girlfriend and i sit outside starbucks.
perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.
i always put cheese in my salads.
they go out to the north parking lot.
no. that will cost too much money.
"yes, they are."
"whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face."
did you watch that golf tournament?
what's wrong with the bed?
don't be nosey.
we can't afford this house.
the sky looks so clean after it rains. i love it.
what did you say?
she's cute.
i hope that i'll see you there.
so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
"but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises."
yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow.
he said he would buy her a nice ring.
i put lemon and butter in it.
"in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too."
i go to pasadena city college.
the one that tiger won?
why not?
my stomach was bothering me.
i don't have even one dollar in it.
what's the matter?
i wonder if every language has jokes.
why not?
why did she leave you?
he made promises that he didn't keep.
does it have a price tag?
then you flew back home that evening?
how much is it?
our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.
we'd better get ready to go.
did you wipe your feet? 
are you sure? i never heard of such a thing.
"so do i, but not if they're rich."
ready for what?
i went to macy's and picked it out.
because you'll have an accident. most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
"yes, but i love the night air after it rains."
i think we should really do something sometime.
the seats and windows are dirty.
"so, they do a good job for the money."
"the other team lost by three points, 101-98. "
i'm having a party this friday.
nothing seems to work.
you might want to buy a pair.
it can be dangerous.
"no, but that was a random change of subject."
who's the greatest baseball player?
you'd better buy your ticket now.
what else can you do?
that's no good.
"oh, all over the world."
"yes, i did. i saved about $50."
i love baseball.
so do i.
what tires?
"i'm sure i'll like it, too."
this city is full of jerks.
"the island is so green, and the water is so blue."
three packs of what?
yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
did it get any better?
no. it's in southern california.
"no, i always back up my files."
"basically, i've been working too."
what was your last job?
i mean you're wasting your life.
of course they talk about us.
you should have been there. it was intense.
"he had cigarettes, but no battery."
i vacuumed the entire house.
do we need reservations?
especially the metal ones.
and we can afford it!
why is that?
i was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on friday.
do you want anything to make you feel better?
i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
"well, i need some help."
that's it? that's all i have to do?
i'll go.
i was missing you too.
but he dives to relax.
i like this magazine.
did you read this article?
"and ruth was a good person, too."
have you attended school today?
but in may it will be 44 cents.
"okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat."
let me think a minute.
would you like anything for your stomach?
"no, not recently."
are you right-handed?
"well, i meant to."
"well, it's one of them."
"so, forget it."
and then he turned right around.
why was that?
why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.
that's nice.
let's play cards.
"yes, it's just a couple of screws."
every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
because i was watching you.
two guys got into an argument.
what are you talking about?
of living.
what's the matter? this is a nice room.
what's bad about it?
really? why?
do you have any other skills?
it's not bad. there are a lot of people there.
i love all their songs.
i don't have long distance service with my home phone.
maybe you should use an electric shaver.
with what?
what is it this time?
many shirts come with an extra button.
i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
"we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears."
of course they match.
i don't like to eat leftovers.
"it has about 140,000 people."
why do you say that?
this looks like a nice table.
that's no good!
because you helped make it dirty.
why not?
so we have to be at the airport at 10:15.
so?
i'm afraid not.
are they comfortable?
i'm going to call you soon. 
i like to slide into the bases.
i'll talk to you later.
let me look at our list.
when are you going?
my ear is killing me.
that was very nice of you.
you're sitting there with your mouth open.
"we had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!"
lunch was delicious.
will you look at this form?
i really don't want to go by myself.
because of all the security?
but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
i think that those are some really nice shoes. what kind are they?
so do i.
i know. i went to china yesterday.
because men like to cheat.
nothing really.
"criminals, of course."
because a puppy costs money.
what's your favorite thing to do?
you started eating ice cream?
is that right?
"no, i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv."
i'm going to give them away. do you want one?
"well, it's really none of your business."
"no, i had no idea."
"yes, he was on the tv news today."
"every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much."
"oh, my goodness. no one is safe on the streets."
"four hours, without a break."
where do you want to go?
and?
how do you prepare the potatoes?
i'm watching you.
is it easy to learn?
i do it every once in a while.
that's ridiculous!
your neighbors will hate you.
what time?
i've been to two doctors.
that sucks. did you want the assignments from english class?
that's such a hassle.
"well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different."
"well, when does the party start?"
have you seen our waiter?
"me, too."
or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
"yes, he made the home run popular."
what do you mean?
do you believe in god?
someone punched out someone.
and they were expensive houses.
that's rude.
i bet you had to drag him away.
so does every smoker.
that's not nice.
i enjoy selling. i was born to sell.
what was it like?
my dad had to buy a new car.
did you look in your desk?
without the peanut butter!
we'll grow old together.
yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
it's almost empty.
he had dirty fingernails.
"don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true."
you should wet your shirt immediately.
i'm taking a math course in school.
i was scratching my nose.
have you heard what happened?
you're watching too much tv.
you can say that again.
i'm going to take a nap.
"for example, if your birth date is january 12, 1987, write 01/12/87."
"i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside."
"they make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave."
i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
how much were they?
okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.
that's a lot of work.
i really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 
i don't know. i think i'm average.
let's leave.
i may know which girl you're talking about.
did you hear about the pilot?
yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.
people take care of their lawns.
it's in a great neighborhood.
"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee."
shake it a couple of times.
okay. it looks like rain.
"but mom, all my friends use their sleeves."
"well, nobody else does, so why should i?"
i'll be there.
how could that be?
of course they talk to each other.
even if it's only for a short while.
a movie sounds good.
i'm pretty good. thanks for asking.
thank you.
what's for dinner?
how do you know?
what is gravity?
were you in a crosswalk?
and then we can turn right at the light.
someone stole his laptop.
a flag should be pretty.
you met a girl at the supermarket?
"i know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot."
what's wrong with looking pale?
then what?
what's wrong with that?
it has great schools.
i can't spend four hours on the road every day.
"you should be happy, not worried."
where does cheese come from?
"boy, that is a good nose."
turn on the light.
"oh, well, it only cost me a dollar."
so she likes poodles.
we don't do anything.
"no, i haven't."
"i'll bet he was drinking, too."
what's that?
do you know what today is?
what's on tv?
i had the worst date the other night.
does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
"oh, i don't care. you're the one who wants to go out."
someone who slips could hurt their back.
"well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air."
the cat doesn't care about your homework.
i'm not sure yet.
"against all of them, of course."
i'll call you later.
i wasn't able to attend school because i was feeling ill.
i've always liked to draw and paint.
what's this stain?
i want to do something tomorrow with you.
the dome doesn't close.
we have to find a cheaper house.
that's my perfume.
"yes, it is."
it went by pretty fast.
i didn't know that you saw superbad before.
"you were, too."
thank you. i just bought these new shoes earlier today.
neither did i.
life isn't fair.
is that right? this is a brand new outfit.
"well, it was nice talking to you."
"do it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials."
"yes, i am really excited."
they are having a good time with our money.
"i didn't want to, so i didn't."
i thought they were playing under a dome.
i will.
i know a good chinese restaurant.
tell me you're joking.
i need a cheap car.
i don't like it reheated.
everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
you're driving too fast.
it's about crime in los angeles.
"really, where did you get it?"
what time does the party start?
how big is los angeles?
"well, it's good that you're so talented."
they want tax cuts.
of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
that's it?
i've actually been pretty good. you?
why did you do that?
it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.
i think i did something real stupid.
i enjoy the different types of instruments that they use.
have you met the new girl?
what's your mailing address?
he should act his age.
did you put the sheets on the beds?
you should see a doctor.
plus installation?
i'm not sleeping here tonight.
"nothing, how about you?"
is it your birthday or anniversary?
i'm not sure yet. is there something you want to see?
"give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you."
what's the point?
i would never want to be president.
i'll call you so we can set that up.
the people are friendly.
i don't know. it's not my mud.
maybe we can go see a movie or something.
are you going to be there?
"out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?"
our team played hard and won.
"oh, yes. we all took lots of pictures."
into the mountains.
that's unbelievable. can he still breathe?
i think that would be nice.
my friend stayed in a hotel on friday the thirteenth.
you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
like what?
and then i made lunch.
do pimples run in your family?
they're best when they're hot.
"yes, i did."
did you have to blow right next to the phone?
"okay, i'm sorry i did it."
"well, mostly i'll try to avoid it."
why not?
i won't be able to play with the kids.
"you're not lying, i found that movie absolutely hilarious."
i'm still feeling a little sick.
"you'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it."
i love peanuts.
"no, he didn't have time to do that."
"no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now."
that was a nice thing to say.
no human could possibly play golf that well.
good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
i have to check the stove.
"there's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?"
i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.
he's been in jail three times already.
a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
"maybe the room is nice, but not the bed."
i'm falling asleep on the phone.
i'm calling the waiter.
did he say what time?
"well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night."
"yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms."
i'm sleepy.
i thought you just bought a pair.
that was a mistake.
i guess you see lots of different dogs.
of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet.
i think i've put on some weight.
what woman?
i really want to go to the movies this weekend.
i can't quit smoking.
have you heard something that you're not telling me?
someone cut the tires.
there are a lot of poor people in new york.
i didn't do anything.
"all it takes is will power, and you have it."
i want to go to the ball game.
do you know what you're going to do this weekend?
they like guys with new cars.
an andy warhol drawing.
that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like?
"well, you'd better take it out front."
i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
"no, please tell me."
that driver is crazy.
i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
"okay, let's go see a movie."
where are you going to school?
"yes, it starts at 7 p.m."
i hope we'll catch a foul ball.
please don't be nosey.
i'm worried.
"no, this is the tree."
how much are they?
"if you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass."
i think we should go out to eat.
i'm terrible at math.
heard what?
"i mean, it's just coffee."
was he smoking?
what did she say?
i don't really want to.
"what does she look like, though?"
where is pasadena?
"up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked."
"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat."
we can go to the river.
no. i already have a pen.
can you go?
the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
the only thing in my backpack is used books.
i went to the beach every day.
i didn't have to. it's been in business for 60 years.
your sleeves are not tissues.
it was like being there?
then neither do women singers.
"but the title of measure 1 is ""better schools at no cost."""
no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.
i want to be a mail carrier when i grow up.
don't mention it.
i'll put on my cap.
i am dying from the heat.
i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
what happened?
i am really excited for you.
"so, why haven't you visited me?"
it's pretty big.
it's on the corner.
"okay, that won't be very crowded."
what's going on?
it doesn't work.
worried about what?
maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
"yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes."
especially on a hot day like this.
you can help me.
you know what i'm talking about.
that will make him so happy.
what are we going to do?
do you have a cold?
dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
"well, it's good and bad."
me too.
i mean i have wonderful students.
see you later.
"if we don't buy it, someone else will."
"so, it's pretty old now."
were you speeding?
is that it?
"i would've come to see you sooner, but i've been busy too."
i feel the same way. it smells so good after it rains.
when is he coming?
what's the matter with that?
what do you mean?
can you imagine being president?
"well, we have a new president."
i want to buy lunch.
i went to see it the day it came out.
"maybe you should, just in case it gets colder."
"nope, and it drives him crazy."
but you'll be asleep in about one minute.
it has beautiful houses.
"oh, that's easy."
are you telling me that you've seen her before?
she's not too tall.
look at the bottom of my shoes — they're clean.
i think that i might.
because i love the snow.
did you do the laundry?
my girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
what's the weather like?
you're right. that movie is hilarious.
so the cop will stop those cars?
that means it gets twice as much traffic.
i will play the radio as loud as i want.
they always need more money.
what's your favorite movie?
you should stop drinking coffee.
that's a good idea.
i need a job.
so it's not worth much?
old movies are the best.
i've never been to a french restaurant.
what are you going to do?
shakespeare was a poet.
your wallet is empty?
my wife left me.
i wish it was a nicer day today.
a car that was owned by a little old lady.
that's a great idea.
"well, i have to go back upstairs anyway."
but thieves don't know that.
such as?
did you get your official sample ballot?
i always try to be polite.
"no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left."
yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.
they never shut up.
what's the matter with it?
i learned back in high school.
but the house is so nice.
i will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick.
that sounds like fun.
i love my computer.
what do you want to do next time?
"oh, yeah."
why would i date someone i don't even know?
the world needs more polite people like us.
but that's impossible.
"whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot."
"honestly, it is one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time."
i will talk to your father about that.
does god answer your prayers?
neither have i.
i couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.
i was thinking about seeing a movie.
and it was only 12 years.
do you think i'm getting fat?
why not?
all they think about is themselves.
what kind of dressing do you use?
i would like to.
i'm busy this friday. i'm sorry.
how many are there?
so am i.
i love boiled peanuts.
i didn't even have lunch.
do you smell that?
"after that, we can dry it with a towel."
you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
"no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up."
"that's great, but you're not supposed to tell me."
"i'm absolutely lovely, thank you."
"but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons."
he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
but typing is causing you pain.
to thank him and all the other soldiers who served in world war ii.
i think it's five miles deep.
they had fireplaces.
i want to watch this tv show.
then stop eating the bread!
but you eat fruits.
i'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
that's the reason it was such a great game.
"yes, but i was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb."
there's something wrong with my orange.
wow! that is nice. let's stay for two nights.
then he didn't bother to apologize.
"yes, they are."
i'm sleepy.
you should carry them in a purse.
everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
it's such a chore.
"oh, no. i forgot."
that's not the attitude of a good driver.
why are you yawning?
"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen."
"exactly, it seems like it's going to be loads of fun."
where are all these people going?
that's the truth.
let's go to the lake.
i was writing a letter.
you can wear this one around the house.
my friend got a ticket for doing 75.
my pants have a hole in the front pocket.
"i'll vote for him next time, too."
they trust in god.
do you know why i pulled you over?
i pour lots of french dressing on top.
i know. every day the weather seems different.
there is no crime here.
oh. of course i'm ready.
why do you like that type of music?
we need a new mattress.
my pen is out of ink.
thank you. that's polite of you to ask.
but i have rabbit ears.
i like that shirt.
i love to eat the peanuts.
what interests you in that type of music?
"yes, the workers are very polite."
i like listening to different kinds of music.
what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
"oh yes, you did."
is there anything you would like to do next time?
"no, like a good amateur golfer."
good luck with school.
i usually eat a simple salad.
where do you go to watch people?
i hope they are fast minutes.
maybe you're right.
but think about all the power you'd have.
how come?
this is she. how's it going?
"they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it."
some guy rowed across the atlantic ocean.
my back is killing me.
to try something new and exciting.
what do you mean?
what did you do at night?
that's hard to take.
"no, you didn't. you slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop."
why do you do that?
they don't believe us?
there will be another show next week.
"well regardless, i'm very happy that you came to see me."
they said they need more money.
and then what?
what do you want to do?
who thinks that?
sunday means we go to church.
i folded all the towels.
can i pick you up friday night?
not sure. is there a movie out that catches your eye?
i turned up the volume.
i wasn't picking my nose.
"that's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently?"
can i try your coffee?
but you're right. there are a lot of fires.
how rude.
that's not good.
"yes. we need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags."
do you want me to wake you in an hour?
"only about $30,000."
i'm joining the army.
why's that?
yes. it is a great movie.
a travel show follows another travel show.
it has great weather all year long.
"for example, a friend of mine licks his lips."
i must not use this finger until the cut heals.
i'm an open book. watch me all you want.
"with toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice."
there were more votes than voters!
"oh, really?"
what are you going to do?
of course.
was there much damage?
we can be there in 20 minutes.
"next saturday, i'm going to have a party."
did you give him a nose?
have you tried nose drops?
"cigarettes, of course."
they also ate with their fingers!
a good story is more important than color.
"just lettuce, tomato, and celery."
it sure isn't.
you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.
sorry about that. i was cleaning up.
it seems that it may rain today.
"wear a jacket, too."
"yeah, let's do that."
how big was it?
why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour.
how can he still be alive?
why did he do that?
you're kidding.
of course not. that would be racist.
they're all asking the same question.
of course. we gave him a big carrot for a nose.
did you hear about the ball player?
they are so weak.
what does it say?
were you able to attend friday night's basketball game?
get out of this lane.
i bought the movie. would you like to come to my house and watch it?
and i want to get a big cabin with a view.
my dad got to see the beautiful new world war ii monument.
what's the matter?
what do you mean?
"yes, i dried everything in the dryer."
maybe the banana was bad.
so why did you get a ticket?
can't you take medicine or something for it?
but we just got here.
my brother is allergic to peanuts.
are you ready?
me too. that movie brought tears to my eyes.
anything else?
"yes, but i will always pet the friendly dogs."
how fast is he going?
i hope i don't come back as a fish.
english.
"no, i was in the crosswalk."
you do? i just bought this outfit a couple days ago.
i will rub gently but firmly.
what do you mean?
i'm not ready to get off the phone with you.
ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
they should find a nice hobby.
what about the baseball game?
i'll see you tomorrow then.
"well, that should get you something."
"i did, but i have to go again."
do you go to college?
didn't you laugh through the whole movie? i did.
i was hoping you would come.
actors didn't curse back then.
"no, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too."
how many invitations has she given out?
"you don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna."
i really hope it doesn't get cold.
i don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.
thank you.
would you like to go to dinner or something?
i used all my savings on this one company.
what kind of cheese?
lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
and the government will give you a fourth story.
to the state or the city?
i've been thinking about learning spanish.
we never have to call the police about anything.
sometimes i want to throw it out the window.
i wasn't really feeling well.
"yes, it's april 22."
it's common sense.
it's sunday.
you're trying to tell me something.
it's hard if you want to do it right.
so do i.
"that would be great, then we could plan things sooner."
"hey, what's good with you?"
my car is dirty.
no problem. so how have you been?
i really hope it rains today.
"number three, it doesn't run 24 hours."
nobody told me.
i've been good. i'm in school right now.
"some men do, but not me."
i care. do something.
the man fell asleep.
you think so?
she told him to drop his girlfriend.
i feel safe here.
"my boss offered me a promotion, and i took it."
all night long we heard people snoring.
i don't smell bad.
"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers."
you don't have any elbow room or knee room.
he said he wasn't using drugs.
what are they paying?
don't vacuum it now.
you would float into the sky like a balloon.
"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him."
"so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt."
is that a lot of work?
"well, i've seen them eating berries."
"oh, look. i have four tens."
our monthly payments will be too high.
"and the pickles were great, too."
let's go to your home.
what was the problem?
i don't know.
what's the matter with it?
"oh, a laptop, of course."
baseball is fun.
especially on these slick floors.
i really can't stand going to parties.
"oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us."
don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
"she asked me how she could return the favor, so i asked her out."
"they don't work, either."
what's the matter?
that's it?
is that right?
it looks like it may rain soon.
"yes, it was."
last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
maybe. what is she like?
so what have you been up to?
"this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen."
they got $1 each.
i hate to go outside.
what are you eating now?
we can watch my dvd.
i add some pepper and salt.
i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.
the sports guy shows us players fighting.
"well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?"
go do your homework.
in case we have visitors.
spring break starts tomorrow.
you don't need a job. i make enough money for both of us.
what for?
we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
who cares?
who were you writing to?
when did he die?
when you go to church?
i warned her about her new boyfriend. she didn't listen to me.
"it usually gets here at noon on tuesday, which is tomorrow."
during the christmas holidays.
at night i went out to eat. the food was delicious.
did you go to the basketball game on friday?
every easter sunday he gives away money.
i started school recently.
of course i will.
tell me what you've been doing.
"okay, until next time then."
that is true. i hope it doesn't rain.
i wanted to see if you wanted to come.
are there any hobbies you do?
what happened?
let's go to the animal shelter.
i really like this house.
what's happening?
i'll put a glove in each pocket.
i'll get him one of those little dogs.
take me to dinner.
"you think so, how come?"
"considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird."
i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
is this a clean restaurant?
i think stamps used to cost a penny.
but you won't date him again?
a blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
what is there to eat?
it's always nice to finish a job.
what happened at the restaurant?
"i'm thinking, but i still have to go."
"number two, it's usually late."
you drink too much coffee.
that's great.
of course you are. you ate everything on the table.
many people think their vote doesn't matter.
i've just been working really hard.
where did you go?
people who live in california are crazy.
but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
i got ripped off.
"nothing really, you?"
i wish i was really smart.
i don't like my job.
you sure do.
"that's right, it really would be."
but we have the same old problems.
like what?
i understand. rain does make it smell cleaner.
it was nice talking to you.
a tree fell onto my dad's car.
"tell me, what do you enjoy doing in your spare time?"
occasionally.
i listen to various types of music.
what do they say about us?
but i am a good driver. i've never had a ticket in my life.
what do you mean?
that must have made you feel really special.
but girls like guys who are funny.
yes. it's on every afternoon.
it's close to the beach.
i'd rather be cold than hot.
there are lots of ugly men singers.
i had a stomachache.
"that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water."
"oh, yes! ""let it be, let it beÂ…"""
the house burned down.
why is that?
i'll help you.
how did you do that?
and you're mine forever.
that sounds like fun. let's do it.
when did you get divorced?
most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
how much money does he give away?
i don't have money or a new car.
"well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today."
"if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god."
you got up real early.
"well, how tall is she?"
you look really nice today. 
did you put the blue bin out on the street?
someone has to win.
i would've thought that somebody would have told you.
me neither. it's boring.
did they catch him?
do you get pbs on tv?
and it gives you money?
i think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
my doctor said i need surgery.
a cooking show follows a sewing show.
it's no trouble at all.
"there are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common."
when does it start?
"especially if it's the same work, over and over."
a band-aid might not work.
"voting is so important, but people don't bother."
yes. it gets a little cool at night.
look at this traffic.
i have to walk the dog.
it was a great game.
thank you very much.
more and more people are using macs.
it's called poker.
these are some chucks.
it's my mom's dog.
did the seller know that?
i went to school today. did you go to school?
i'm not. i just want to know.
thank you. i just got this outfit the other day.
thank you.
"yes, i do."
i like to see actors who are like real people.
i love to go online.
he might tell me to rest for a while.
of course. what else?
only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
"well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces."
it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
i'll talk to you later.
can't you report him to his supervisor?
i sent them an email asking for my money back.
let me step outside and see.
"while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food."
"i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset."
all i get is a black screen.
i especially love the night air when it rains.
i bought some stock.
"no pets, no smoking."
how long will it take me to learn?
housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.
we'll stop at the next mcdonald's.
so what are you going to do?
"well, listen to me. you need to buy a ticket now."
he never wins your money?
of course. did you?
i'm really glad that you came to see me.
what did you buy?
"no, thanks, maybe another time."
sounds like it was a close game.
i got a d in college chemistry.
i'll say! i've gone around the world a dozen times already!
i like the political cartoons.
i cut my finger.
i have to get off the phone now.
and you get a lot of exercise every day.
my shoes are shined.
i feel sorry for you.
"i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter."
you had pizza for lunch.
like what?
i ate free cheese and meat every day.
you can yell at them.
"well, congratulations."
she's got a great personality.
"man, that was a really close game."
what are we waiting for?
i like my food hot and fresh.
i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.
and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
"it's too far from your job, isn't it?"
did you double-check your nose and teeth?
it's okay. it's a really big campus.
why is that?
the officer said the red hand was blinking.
what do you mean?
i enjoyed talking to you too.
really? what kind of shoes are they?
what do you need for school?
it's too bad that i couldn't make it. who won?
what else?
did you write a letter to grandma?
i voted for ralph nader.
"well, i know how to flip hamburgers."
it was nothing for him.
sure. here you go.
oh.
did you hear that?
golf is so hard.
"no, the white walk sign was blinking."
do you have a car?
me too. i can't wait until winter.
"that's about $30,000."
i don't think he even got paid for it.
"yeah, but i'm still waiting for my invitation."
i agree.
"no, it's dark pink!"
do they allow pets?
the tv news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
i don't know. look in the fridge.
"no, when i call him on his cell phone."
the score was 101-98.
why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
i think that's an excellent reason to like something.
maybe we should get rid of him.
why is that?
"that should be a nice trip. lots of fun, and lots of food."
people are funny.
that's a bad day.
she was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces.
did you go to the 99 cents store?
except we can't afford it!
i already looked there.
of course i do. but not on our flag!
why do you hate to go outside?
i like the ones i can sing along with.
then i did my laundry.
then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
"you won't catch me, because i love you. i'm not a cheater."
"i mean, keep your belongings close to you."
i don't want any other woman.
what article?
why's that?
do your students ever talk about their jobs?
how come?
my hard drive crashed.
i love that show.
the speed limit is 65!
i hope i come back as a cat.
bacon and eggs?
i started shopping at the dollar store.
let's go to an early movie.
so what were you calling me about?
i bought lots of oranges and apples.
okay. i just put a stamp on the envelope.
did you put the letter in an envelope?
it has wonderful restaurants.
sunday is mother's day.
i think it was about 45 minutes long.
"so then, why don't you just go?"
i couldn't wait. it was an emergency.
"okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please."
how do they do that?
yes.
what happened to your car?
i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.
they talk about other animals.
what's the matter with this one?
he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
"everybody loved him, all over the nation."
parking at school is impossible.
i need some pants.
i bought you a pair of pants.
who ever heard of such a thing?
my family and i are going to dinner.
i haven't seen her yet.
"yes, it would be. "
it's a paper cut.
i'd like that.
you like the rain?
three different people will give you three different stories.
okay. i think i'll be awake by then.
i have no idea. i've been here for 20 years.
how did you like it?
you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
why didn't you go before we left?
"it's time for your bath, young lady."
i'll just use the atm.
"i'm going to the store, would you like any pepto bismol?"
i've been really busy.
i started teaching five years ago.
"that's nice, have you been to the movies lately?"
did you get fat?
when are they going to fix this problem?
i'm getting married.
"yes, of course i wiped my feet."
this hot bread is delicious.
people need to cover their trash cans.
"they always tell us ""what's next."""
i don't like our flag.
"i'll give you a speech like that, too."
you're yawning.
where are the band-aids?
you didn't read about the company first?
so i should stop thinking?
but what if i'm a fish in my next life?
just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
high school or middle school?
so what's the problem?
it's too much like other flags.
he sounds like a real jerk.
is there a game tonight?
why?
i never thought about that.
do you have a girlfriend?
i loved it. i want to live there.
congratulations on your promotion.
is it in northern california?
there's something wrong with my right hand.
"but, mom, i'm not dirty."
why not?
i hope we'll see a home run.
"i still have my job, thank goodness."
i don't think i'm going to dream about anything. i'm really tired.
he moved out of our house.
"i love to watch ""judge judy."""
she had good reason. what did she do?
why?
exactly what?
"if you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous."
what makes it so good?
so what's the problem?
i loved it!
"i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself."
that's all right.
it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.
i'm not sure.
i want to cruise to hawaii.
see you soon.
my fingers hurt.
he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.
"thanks. i think you look nice today, too."
isn't it a nice day?
then they're worth every penny.
it must've been a close game.
you know what you did.
i loved you the first day i saw you.
"well, the democratic party says it was an honest election."
what are you doing this weekend?
how do you know?
"no, i'm serious."
this is such a long light.
oh really? i didn't know that.
"well, i want to see ""the pursuit of happyness."""
the street isn't wet.
yes. i bought a cadillac.
you can't see the end of it.
"well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual."
so?
did she catch you using drugs?
you don't like pretty women?
"yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside."
how was the weather?
do you know why?
like real people with real problems.
"yes, it does. it's only $20."
sure. why not?
how many?
do you listen to the radio?
"well, of course i want to go when the weather is nice."
because they always do.
about what?
"he might relax, but it makes me nervous."
when are we going to stop?
that's harsh.
how did you like it?
why did you do that?
where do you live?
"well, would you like to go?"
children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
okay. i'll return your pen when i'm done.
it's close to the mountains.
"oh, really?"
"the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know."
how about you see a movie with me and my friend?
pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.
how about a dictionary?
"well, you're supposed to be working."
where do the students go?
all you've lost is some sweat.
i hope that it does rain.
so was i.
where's the pencil sharpener?
the internet is amazing.
why not?
"yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer."
"i read it once, and i subscribed."
how's it going?
i love to eat the hot dogs.
when did you learn how to do that?
i guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
yes.
that sounds a lot easier than sewing.
he thinks i have too much stress.
"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone."
when do you have to be at the airport?
i feel so sorry for those people.
it's one dollar for 100 minutes.
great. which one?
it leaves at 12:15.
what's wrong with them so soon?
"i found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me."
how about a pizza?
that sounds great.
what else do they talk about?
did you even bother to go to school today?
but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
you're driving too fast.
i'm going to have to say that superbad is the best movie ever.
some private organization.
i eat the same thing every day.
i've been working too.
did you buy the converter?
they probably will.
all day long we heard tvs or telephones.
"same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp."
did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
i loved it. i still remember how amazing it was.
do you think a bear is a cow?
"when i started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking."
he probably won't use drugs anymore.
i know that.
last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
i like the kinds of instruments that they use.
stress causes different problems with different people.
"yes, the snow is fun."
i always read the film reviews.
"i've heard about it, but i'm still waiting for my invitation."
"well, i think we are paying for it."
not me. i want to play for the dodgers.
he changed the game.
i have a date tomorrow night.
i've never heard him say please or thank you.
"i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see."
it's perfect for us and the kids.
that sounds like a great job.
did you feed the cat?
i got a ticket yesterday.
i like a good story.
"yes, i would love one."
"no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little."
where did you lose it?
did he understand what the problem is?
"yes, it's better to get there too early than too late."
why do they hurt?
shots for what?
i didn't know that.
i was busy doing something. i apologize.
i don't have any idea.
you get to put someone in power that you like.
"no, i'm looking for another family."
"he was invited, along with about 90 other veterans."
i'd better see you there.
"oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?"
"all right, so i'll see you then."
the son gave a nice speech about his father.
they talk about food and the weather.
"no, i didn't."
"i really don't know, but i don't think she gave out that many yet."
i don't want fruit. i want something tasty.
then what did you do?
it only took about two hours.
working.
i don't really like parties.
what are those wipes for?
i hate homework.
my parents go to church every sunday.
but i stopped!
where's the mustard?
who invited them?
"well, he's got plenty of time now!"
it would be nice if the weather would never change.
"yes, i do."
you and everybody else.
so do i.
it was before i was born.
don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
it seems fine to me.
what's the weather going to be like? i may want to go too.
what's going on?
the election is next week.
i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
who invented flossing?
"nothing much, what's going on?"
too bad i was busy. i really wanted to go.
those are great. how much were they?
i went to hawaii on vacation.
"so do i, but i'm worried."
"yes, they are."
what happened?
that wouldn't seem right.
"oh, that's terrible. what does she look like now?"
let me think about it.
are there fish at the bottom?
sure. why do you need it?
of course.
what's that?
i've been great. what about you?
"oh, that's so delicious."
gravity is very important.
i think it's the ice cream.
what does she do?
"yes, cheese is nice."
one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
"no, but my feet don't hurt anymore."
we get hamburgers and steak.
"yes, a thrift shop has that same smell."
no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
"i have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey."
they might think i'm stupid.
me too.
because it will protect you in case of an accident.
especially on toast.
she weighs 98 pounds.
a ham sandwich.
you didn't?
i wish it would cool off one day.
but i love pizza.
i'll teach you one.
"well, i guess that's why he did it."
luxury plus speed.
look at these marks on my arms.
what about the pillowcases?
something's wrong with my computer.
"yes, but who is the greatest?"
only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.
did you use a new blade?
"no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october."
"well, did you want to go see a movie with me?"
you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
bring me a better steak.
are you enjoying it there?
that's not nice.
that would be weird.
"when you finish, all you do is start another job!"
"no, the banana was delicious."
do your socks match?
i've also been busy.
"finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground."
okay. i did something.
i parked it right here.
wow! that's terrible.
i've just been working a lot.
yes. i've never been there.
how good is your math?
maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
"me, too. i love them roasted and salted."
"yes, i looked there, too."
that's great. congratulations.
what do we need to buy?
that's a great idea.
the point of what?
the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
no problem.
"if you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals."

what do you do?
"not a lot, what about you?"
i'm not sleeping on that sheet.
they look so stupid taking a puff.
the nation is switching to digital tv.
has she given out a lot of invitations yet?
"a dentist, i'm sure."
you're right. you have to stand in the aisle.

now he's slowing down.
i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
so?
what will you do?
"okay, what do you want to sell?"
yes?
i'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.
"she has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful."
i don't see anything.
why do you have to think about it?
that would be fun.
what's the matter?
"yeah, are you going to come?"
i think i might've bumped into her before.
if only i was talented.
they're only $5 each.
"i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?"
that's too bad.
i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.
they think it's cool.
the league suspended him for 50 games.
i think it's an old people's smell.
he helped make the yankees the best team ever.

any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.
i'm actually in school right now.
i'm gaining weight.
"sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't."

"no, i just blow my nose a lot."
"this friday? sorry, i already have plans."
he's the only candidate that i trust.
do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
why?
because you're thinking too much.
rich people think they're better than us.
don't you want me to clean up the mud?
"he can, but the people around him can't."
that means it will get hotter.
it's on the tip of my finger.
how long was the flight?
"without gravity, you would go up."

i was going to be a doctor.
i never miss the food and drink section.
