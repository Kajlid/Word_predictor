"no, i haven't. why?"
that is a beautiful house.
"number one, it's too slow."
"no, i haven't."
thank you. i just got these shoes today.
"boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?"
did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.?
$140. i can't believe it.
more and more people are using macs.
bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
i have a little poodle.
the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
i think it's the ice cream.
i'll call you later.
i need pencils.
you have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend?
wow! that's terrible.
that's a great idea.
it's on the corner.
let's turn on the heat.
i was busy the whole day.
they brushed with their fingers.
you are coming?
let's take a walk.
"yes, it is."
i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
a mad dog bit most of her face off.
a ham sandwich.
"okay, mom, maybe i was picking it a little bit."
why? i still wanted to talk to you.
i'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
that's only a penny a minute!
sure. here you go.
what else do they talk about?
it should be warmer in a few minutes.
"yes, but i was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb."
i don't think he even got paid for it.
they're all the same.
we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.
did you even bother to go to school today?
what's on tv?
that's only a penny a minute!
so do i.
my friend got a ticket for doing 75.
what happened?
what woman?
"yes, it was."
good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
do you think a bear is a cow?
no. that will cost too much money.
i'm a babysitter.
i need to type to make money.
what are you going to do with an english major?
are you married?
can i borrow $5?
i vacuumed the entire house.
it should be warmer in a few minutes.
i had a long day.
talk to you later.
"excuse me. hurricane andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!"
"that's great, but you're not supposed to tell me."
"okay, let's go see a movie."
shots for what?
why?
thank you.
but in may it will be 44 cents.
what do you mean?
"number three, it doesn't run 24 hours."
it's really nice.
you're right. buses don't run late at night.
we went to a nice restaurant.
two students from usc.
"no, i didn't."
i'd better see you there.
what did you like?
"yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet."
i really like those. how much did they cost?
i'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow.
i'll help you.
so go then.
who makes up all these jokes?
the weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
what's going on with you?
it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
you're driving too fast.
i found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
the wind blows those trucks over.
tell me you're joking.
that's a good idea.
i haven't seen her yet.
some guy rowed across the atlantic ocean.
i've also been busy.
where did you park it?
how could that be?
let me think about it.
"sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't."
i've been working too.
people think you might be sick.
that sounds like a great job.
that's no good.
so? that's a ticket?
it's in a great neighborhood.
"no, like a good amateur golfer."
where do you go to watch people?
it's to my mom.
here you go.
"oh, really? then spend tonight looking at the sofa."
where do you want to go?
"i'm not being nosey, it's just a question."
the husband said a fire department was nearby.
did they explain how it's possible?
because men like to cheat.
can you imagine being president?
can you make it?
singers are supposed to sound good.
does it pick up any digital channels?
being broke is no fun.
i may know which girl you're talking about.
i started teaching five years ago.
"take me to a nice restaurant, not to mcdonald's."
when you go to church?
maybe we can catch a home run ball.
"this friday? sorry, i already have plans."
the one that tiger won?
"exactly, it seems like it's going to be loads of fun."
he sounds like a real jerk.
i really like those. how much did they cost?
"i had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them."
i think we should go out to eat.
"well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop."
"that's not what i meant by ""do something."""
so are they going to hold another election?
i have the dvd.
did you go to school today?
i don't know. maybe it was from a shopping cart.
i'd have to say babe ruth.
"me, too. school was fun."
"no, i'm serious."
"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone."
"well, you should do something that you enjoy."
i'm having fun.
a movie sounds good.
these are chucks.
we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
plus installation?
i've been great. what about you?
i don't feel like going.
what do the teachers do?
you don't need to worry about that.
how are you going to do that?
"yes, he made the home run popular."
that sounds like a dream job.
it's on the tip of my finger.
so do i.
yelling doesn't do any good.
maybe it will go away in a little while.
my wife and i will be cremated.
you think?
i love to eat the hot dogs.
or artists.
but we have the same old problems.
the ocean is so big.
it's no trouble at all.
do you know what today is?
there are so many great players.
i was unable to make it.
is that a tv show?
singers are supposed to sound good.
"sooner or later, voters will wake up."
are you interested?
i haven't been better. how about yourself?
it aches most of the time.
how do you know?
"oh, yes."
you're forgetting about the bathroom.
you're watching too much tv.
"well, of course i want to go when the weather is nice."
don't vacuum it now.
because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.
do you have a digital tv?
great. which one?
"well, it's really none of your business."
your white shirt is ruined.
"yes, he went through the red light."
i want to watch this tv show.
most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
maybe they towed it away.
how come?
"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat."
there must be something on tv!
i can't believe he hasn't crashed.
"well, why don't you?"
so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
you need a bath every day.
it was on sale.
don't drink milk out of the carton. use a glass!
"so, why haven't you visited me?"
that's what you think.
"and when elected, they go their own way."
it gets worse every year.
you don't have any elbow room or knee room.
why is that?
so i should stop thinking?
i don't want any other woman.
of course they talk about us.
it sure is.
that's the reason it was such a great game.
let's go to the lake.
it was new in 2003.
"yes, i saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters."
are you going to go and visit her and the baby?
"mom, i'm hungry."
that's a lot.
"i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary."
it's got a big yard.
"okay, okay! i'll make a reservation right now."
"the usual, cereal with milk and a banana."
what did your father do?
"okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please."
i'll say! i've gone around the world a dozen times already!
what is it that you need to do? 
"and it's deep, too."
no.
that's what everyone says.
i don't know. i think it's old age.
what difference does it make?
"i think i know, because this happened before."
"it's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today."
it's too much like other flags.
what's a little blood?
where's the pencil sharpener?
"no, i couldn't make it."
i was writing a letter.
don't they clean the bus every night?
can't we hire more police?
is that a tv show?
"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him."
i turned up the volume.
what husband?
"yeah, so are you planning on going?"
she's got a great personality.
i don't like it.
people are friendly.
"yes, they are."
i bought it from the macy's at the santa anita mall.
"oh, yes, because of all the killer germs."
"okay, i'll get a bucket."
i honestly didn't know.
those books will slip and you'll fall.
but it won't stop other players from using drugs.
"we need cheese, bread, and ham."
why do you do that?
especially for drivers of big trucks.
"yes, and it takes about five minutes each time."
okay. let's get a new mattress.
and then we can turn right at the light.
we figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.
you have pretty eyes.
what is this world coming to?
"i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter."
what do you mean?
i can't wait till i grow up.
"you know, that woman with the big boobs."
what are you going to be doing?
the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
"yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember."
are you having problems with it?
i had no idea.
yes. it's not expensive!
i'll help you.
nothing much.
"you don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna."
they were in the student parking lot.
do you believe in god?
a family with only one baby.
i love salads.
"oh, no. i forgot."
i think i did something real stupid.
who knows? maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.
probably not.
there's something wrong with my right hand.
"yes, in fact, i did."
just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
we need a new mattress.
i voted for obama.
we'll be here forever.
without the peanut butter!
i was hoping you would come.
why not?
why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.
no. they can only give a ticket if they see it happen.
but i got lucky a few minutes later.
were you able to attend friday night's basketball game?
has she given out a lot of invitations yet?
what's the weather like?
what college do you go to?
"yes, but i can't keep them."
can't you report him to his supervisor?
it's so nice to have a heated apartment.
i type too much.
"okay, i'll take it out front right now."
"yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven."
natural food has more vitamins.
it passes inspection.
why did you get divorced?
"hey, what's good with you?"
it's not orange!
i don't want to go to hell.
i really have to go.
i really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 
then why were you looking at her?
why do you like that type of music?
it went by pretty fast.
"yes, and he didn't tell the buyer."
"you have lots of friends. they will be there, too!"
all night long we heard people snoring.
i don't know how that store makes money.
what do you mean?
and then he turned right around.
boiled? i never heard of that.
"me, neither."
no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
but maybe prices will be cheaper in october.
that's not nice.
what tires?
i don't understand.
did you have a date friday night?
"yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms."
what do you mean?
people will tell you if they have a good hand.
of course.
"no, they don't. one is black and one is dark blue."
then they're worth every penny.
"i know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot."
that is a joke.
i have to feed them.
who did you go out with?
"well, it's your life."
i couldn't wait. it was an emergency.
i'm in a hurry.
he's visiting other cities to get ideas.
"yes, i do."
you're trying to tell me something.
"if you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass."
i like a good story.
i like this magazine.
it goes on and on forever.
that's okay.
you mean i will smell the food cooking?
i'm going to the movie theater with my friend. what are you going to do?
they need a left-turn arrow.
of course. he stops the fastest cars.
they bark at everything.
"yes, i am really excited."
you do? i just bought this outfit a couple days ago.
"but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises."
what did you wash?
do you want to go out to eat?
is it new?
thank you.
"this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?"
i want to show you my new car.
buy a new one.
that's what you say now. wait till you're 50.
"next time you go to the market, let me go with you."
"i did, but i have to go again."
what will you do?
then why were you looking at her?
and they're clean.
i had a stomachache.
tell me when you finish.
a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
