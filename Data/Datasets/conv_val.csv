you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.
how so?
"number four, it's too crowded."
why not?
you can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
that's what many people believe.
i believe that she will give me the invitation today.
yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.
"no, my sister and i will travel together."
but a house is so expensive.
poems are a little bit like songs.
"for me, it's the students."
it sure is windy today.
that's what i do.
i'm still feeling under the weather.
it was the best game ever.
that's very nice.
not if we save every penny.
i'm going to the movies with a friend. how about you?
the worst in the whole world.
my sister had a cold. she gave it to me.
so?
you still miss him.
i guess they haven't read this article.
how smart are you?
why? we're already late.

it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.
"yes, i think he did."
i think we'll be there in half an hour.
see those stains?
"yes, everybody gets the public broadcasting system."
why didn't she love you anymore?
"number one, it's too slow."
and then you hit it again.
i haven't lately.
i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
"i just peeled it, and i'm looking at it right now."
a new hotel is looking for workers.
being broke is no fun.
why not?
i hope you feel better.
"oh, no, it isn't!"
what's wrong?
it was like the real thing.
i'm on a new diet.
who did you go out with?
"oh, yes."
that's a lot.

that sounds delicious.
what movie are you and your friend planning on watching?
what do you mean?
i really wish i went to the game.
it isn't easy to see.
"well, someone brought it into the house."
"if i smelled bad, i could smell me."
i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
why's that?
but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
it got rained out.
"oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich?"

boiled? i never heard of that.
i want to go to see a movie this weekend.

are there more fish or more people?
"well, superbad is super funny."
it's a flying zoo!
"this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?"
but no one knows for sure.
oh. that's simple enough.
maybe i should see a doctor.

that sounds good.
what was the lead story on the news?
they say they want change.
i sure hope so.
that election for u.s. senator stunk.
"if we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell."
"i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes."
they forget who put them in power.
where did you lose it?
"no, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood."
don't drink milk out of the carton. use a glass!
then why were you looking at her?
"it's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today."
where's your money?
like what?
do you believe the tv ads?
"like ""one, two, buckle my shoe."""
a tutor helped me get the d!
"i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility."

it sure is.
i don't understand some things.
this trail is hard to climb.
we can kill two birds with one stone.
is that right? i already got my invitation from her earlier.
then wait till you find a tissue.
"well, just call the front desk. they'll give us new sheets."
and now i'm glad that i didn't.
what about her facial features?
don't ever be in a hurry.
maybe you should stop shaving.
i need to fly to new york.
i think about nice things.
what's the weather like?
yikes! who can remember all that?
now a stamp is 42 cents.

why do they call it the good old days?
babies cry all the time.

good luck with that.

but it went by fast. it was interesting.

even though they're in black and white.
did he get rich from his poetry?
i was laughing through the whole movie.
i think about twenty-five.
debrah had her baby last week.
what difference does it make?
me too. they canceled their other news magazines.
but the same thing day after day gets old.
that's a good idea.
what kind of change?
no.
we need to save money.
maybe. i'm not sure.
no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.
